This study shows how mapping postoil spill incidents can provide insights into the fate of 
sensitive ecosystems and serve as a decisionsupport tool for reducing the negative socio
environmental impacts of oil spills The incidence of oil spills along pipelines have expanded in 
extent into habitats of sensitive natural ecosystems and threatens biodiversity conservation in 
Nigeria These oil spills directly and indirectly influence critical ecosystems functioning such as 
protected areas wildlife wetlands waterbodies marine animals and plants natural vegetation 
types and arable lands for food production The geovisualised oil spill records overlaid on 
GoogleEarth images provided geolocational insights and intelligence that aid inferences on the 
impacts of oil spill incidents using geospatial mapping tools and webservice to support decision
making purposes in the oil spill management cycle Furthermore geospatial analysis of oil spills 
data from 2006 to 2019 along the 5000 km of pipelines with the 2017 World Database of 
Protected Areas revealed numerous perils oil spills pose to the proper functioning and 
sustainability of terrestrial and marine ecosystems Results showed that 630 verified oil spills 
occurred in the forest reserves along the pipelines Approximately 120 verified oil spills were 
recorded in game reserves and 210 verified oil spills occurred in Ramsar sitewetlands of 
international importance The oil spills that occurred along these pipelines are threats to the 
existence of intact tropical rain forests savannah forests and protected areas since they intersect 
critical ecosystems Numerous terrestrial and marine inhabitant were affected by oil spill events 
including land and underground water pollution loss of human livelihood heavy metal pollution 
loss of farmland and damage of animal habitat This assessment showed that the fusion of relevant 
environmental dataset is crucial in evaluating the fate sensitivity and vulnerability of landscapes 
to oil spills using geomapping and geovisualization concepts In the context of achieving 
environmental sustainability and smart oil pipeline provisioning in line with the global Sustainable 
Development Goals SDGs it is essential to use Geoinformation tools such as integrated spatial 
planning and landuse concepts to evaluate potential perils linked to oil infrastructure 
development Outcomes from impact assessment research of this kind should be incorporated as 
strategic tools for developing informed conservation economy policies industry practices and 
good environmental governance mechanism for robust decisionmaking in the oil and gas sector 
of Nigeria towards attaining localscale SDGs

Introduction 
Petroleum products derived from oil and gas activities are a major contributor to terrestrial and 
marine economy in Nigeria They are one of the highly demanded and priced commodities in the 
extractive industry Unfortunately the processes involved in exploration extraction and 
transportation of oil and gas petroleum products mostly impede on the environment with long
term impacts and cascading effects Kingston 2002 Consequently oil and gas activities remain 
one of the human actions that exert numerous direct and indirect impacts on sensitive and 
important ecological landscapes in Nigeria 
Extant literature show that environmental pollution emanating from oil and gas activities results 
in serious ecological damages causing marine organisms to die or flee Lee 2011 LindstedtSiva 
1980 Moore 2006 This result in environmental and socioeconomic costs which is a major 
concern to environmental scientists and managers For example oil spillages occur in Nigeria 
through oil pipelines that is one of the means of conveying refined petroleum products or crude oil 
from sources such as oil wells to destination mainly refinery Oil spill incidents considered to be 
damaging to sensitive and vulnerable environment have occurred in oil producing regions of 
Nigeria The alarming and persistent occurrence of oil spills with negative impacts causes pockets 
environmental devastation such as contamination of soil land degradation pollution of 
underground water persistent vegetation cover damage marine ecosystems and public health 
issues in Nigeria This has been confirmed by the independent assessment of the Ogoniland in 
2011 UNEP 2011 
Of particular concern is how oil spillages caused by thirdparty interference are occurring along 
oil pipelines in the NigerDelta and is gradually spreading along oil pipelines into the hinterland 
of Nigeria Figure 1 The impacts of the oil spillages on important natural habitat and how the 
ecological services provided by these environments are under immense attack Here we describe 
an “oil spill tsunami” along petroleum products pipeline in Nigeria with focus on Nigeria’s Niger
Delta and the hinterland of Nigeria Figure 1 Locations experiencing oil spillage in these regions 
have drawn intense scrutiny and concern lately The occurrences of oil spillages contravene 
environmental laws in Nigeria FGN 2006 and does not meet international standards of 
environmental protection practices Oil spillages are generally caused by thirdparty interference 
and has specifically continued because of failure to comply with the National Oil Spill Detection 
and Response Agency NOSDRA regulations derived from Act 15 establishing NOSDRA in 
2006 
Across Nigeria thirdparty oil spillage occurrences are expanding at an unprecedented pace 
and rate These oil spillages have occurred with high density visible in the NigerDelta as 
highlighted in white rectangle showing oil spill density in red circles in Figure 1 These reported

oil spill crisscross much of the NigerDelta’s fragile landscape due to the presence major oil 
industry operations and infrastructure since the last five decades The tendency of oil spill is 
beginning to extend to the hinterland as is evident in Figure 1 see linear pattern of red and grey 
circles moving northward Nigeria The increasing pace of oil spillage in Nigeria threatens the 
continuity of a safe and healthy environment in Nigeria If balanced environment is needed that 
does not compromise the standards of living of current and future generations the Nigerian 
environment must be protected from future occurrences of oil spillages 
 
Figure 1 Geovisualization of oil spill pattern across Nigeria in a webGIS platform 
It is essential that already impacted sites by oil spills must be well understood and managed in 
a spatially explicit context using and array of Geospatial Information Technologies GIT 
comprised of Global Positioning Systems GPS Remote Sensing RS and Geographic 
Information Systems GIS These tools are useful for pre and post impact analyses of oil spill to 
enable environmental scientists and managers provide sustainable environmental practices that 
support response recovery remediation and resilience concepts Consequently reducing the 
impacts oil spill and land degradation GIT support the delivery of good environmental governance 
frameworks that are measurable through indicators such as the global targets of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals SDGs

The questions addressed in this research work are How does the oil and gas activities threaten 
the wellbeing of Nigerian What are the risks associated with oil and gas activities imminent to 
the sensitive and ecologically important landscapes in Nigeria How can NOSDRA effectively 
manage oil spillages in Nigeria With respect to policies Are there current policies in place to 
help reduce environmental damage caused by oil and gas activities in Nigeria Furthermore this 
research aimed to map oil spill pattern in the NigerDelta along the pipeline hinterland and 
highlight the fate of sensitive environments in Nigeria These questions will be addressed in the 
following sections This study therefore aims to provide a comprehensive elucidation of the 
potentials and roles of geospatial technologies in managing oil spills especially using the publicly 
available archives of Landsat series Sentinel and Google Earth platform using integrated remote 
sensing GIS and GPS analysis contributing to the understanding of oil spill detection and 
management in Nigeria 
 
A Threats of oil and gas activities to the wellbeing of Nigeria 
The enormous quantity of oil and gas deposits is seemingly the most vulnerable natural resource 
in Nigeria especially in the NigerDelta Ajibade  Awomuti 2009 A similar situation is likely 
to be experienced with more recent discoveries in the hinterland Between 2008 and 2017 over 
789 billion barrels of oil were exploited from over 5000 wells NNPC Annual Statistical Bulletin 
2017 However the wellbeing of Nigeria in terms of diversified economy is threatened by the 
perils oil and gas activities impose on the Nigerian environment For instance agricultural 
activities including fishing is threatened in the NigerDelta due to the occurrence of oil spill which 
is linked to oil and gas activities One of the implications of oil spill to human wellbeing is that 
agriculture and food production for sustenance which is an indicator to wellbeing is threatened 
both in quality and quantity or yield Importantly oil spills aggravate degradation of arable land 
which threatens the continued sustainability of the environments used for food production and 
food security agenda Overall the wellbeing threats of oil spills destabilizes the socioeconomic 
status of oil polluted regions and consequently hinders or disenfranchises such locations from the 
attainments of the SDGs Considering that oil spill is linked with oil and gas activities it remains 
a major threat to Nigeria’s wellbeing because of the country’s the over reliance on revenues 
generated from the oil and gas industry Yet despite the huge income from crude oil and gas sales 
this revenue has so far not helped to alleviate the large majority from chronic poverty as the most 
densely populated county in Africa Unfortunately the COVID19 pandemic further exposed how 
Nigeria’s wellbeing is threatened by the fragility of extractive commodity prices such as the drop 
in crude oil earnings by 90 which affected Nigeria’s 2020 budget and subsequently influenced 
the proposed federal government spending intents

B Environmental and Socioecological risks of oil spill in Nigeria 
There are numerous socioecological threats prevalent and imminent to sensitive and 
environmentally important landscapes associated with oil and gas activities in Nigeria The 
persistent oil spill incidents with hydrocarbons is one of the greatest environmental pollution 
threats with attendant socioecological risks in Nigeria Although there are numerous causes of oil 
spills here the focus is on incidents along pipeline which impose negative impacts on landcover 
such as soils vegetation surface water and aquifers and have damaged substantial portion of 
forests in the NigerDelta Figure 2 In truth over 15 million barrels of oil have been spilled in 
the Nigerian environment since 1958 to date based on estimates of reported oil spill incidents  
 
Figure 2 
Some of the longterm environmental and socioecological risks connected to oil spill incidents 
is the destruction of endangered flora and fauna loss of biodiversity food chain destabilization 
and aggravation of human health challenges Bayode  Adewunmi 2011 Moore 2006 Oil spill 
can lead to longterm ecological impact such as biodiversity loss For instance the physical 
smothering by tar residues effectively reduces habitat diversity by binding substrata and filling of

pore spaces which reveals the most conspicuous longterm impacts on biodiversity and 
productivity Another longterm ecological risk caused by oil spill is the loss of natural forest cover 
and rapid change in LandUse LandCover LULC Figure 2 Mangroves are one of the 
threatened forests covers by oil spills in the NigerDelta The decline or extinction of this important 
vegetation in the NigerDelta is strongly linked with oil spill impact UNEP 2011 If oil spill 
impacts on mangroves are not halted the combined longterm effects will contribute some other 
environmental consequences such as flooding prevalent in the NigerDelta This further aggravate 
oilexploitation related threat and by implications increases floodwater which disperses large 
amount of sediments into the environment as can be observed in the detail study region Figure 2 
 
C Measures to effectively management of oil spillages in Nigeria 
The effective management of oil spill requires compelling analysis that help to understand the 
current and potential effects of oil pollution on sensitive ecosystems and humans For instance the 
geospatial visualization of oil spill locations on all water bodies along pipelines in the hinterland 
and NigerDelta can help identify locations of water related contamination Figure 3 In addition 
the geospatial overlay of oil spill locations on LULC can support impact assessment arguments 
necessary to effectively identify threatened sensitive and vulnerable landcover that require in
depthcase management such as remediation actions  
Despite the hard time NOSDRA is facing to proactively detect oil spills being an Agency 
saddled with the responsibility of implement the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan NOSCP 
the Agency has devised innovative and compelling approach to showcase and understand the 
potential effects oil spill can have on sensitive environments across Nigeria  Beginning from 2009 
the need to mainstream Geoinformation into oil spill management in NOSDRA for Nigeria was 
indispensable In 2012 there was the need to conceptualize how the collated oil spillage records 
can be geovisualized for a spatial overview and further analytical capability to facilitate proactive 
decisionmaking This focused the collaboration between NOSDRA and Stakeholder Democracy 
Network to develop the webbased tool now referred to as the oil spill monitor 
httpsoilspillmonitorng Considering that the Nigerian environment has a tragic record of 
pollution due to oil spillage yet no systematic geospatial visualization and analysis has been 
available about the potential impacts of spills on sensitive ecosystems along pipelines in Nigeria 
This study revealed interesting spatial pattern of oil spill especially from thirdpart interference 
across Nigeria using RS and GIS analyses Figure 3

The Nigerian Oil Spill Pattern and the Fate of Sensitive Environment 
The mapping of oil spill incidents including those along pipelines is an effective effort to 
understand oil spill pattern its impact on environment prevent future oil spill incidences and 
strengthen oil spill response plan Therefore incorporating mapping in the planning and practice 
of oil spill response such as control containment and cleanup becomes critical to minimize the 
ecological impacts of oil spills to sensitive environments in Nigeria Clear goals of mapping as a 
planning and preventive measure are needed in executing oil spill response whether at individual 
company level oil clean up cooperative or state and federal government agency In addition the 
mapping of oil spill impacted sites is an effective approach to transparently carry along all group 
involved in oil field assessment stage to agree on actions to be achieved This is necessary because 
conflicts of interest arise when transparency and traceability is lacking in site assessment and the 
investigation teamwork at cross purpose for different goals For instance responding to oil spill 
incidence along oil pipeline requires the stoppage of oil from source restoration of the pipeline 
integrity and cleanup of the immediate environment 
A true gamechanger for Nigeria nature and ecological conservation is the pattern of oil spills 
occurring along petroleum products pipeline across sensitive environments in Nigeria Figure 4 
If left in their entirety without cleanup and restoration the spills would collectively have long
term ecological impacts on sensitive natural ecosystems in Nigeria

Aligning oil spill management with Sustainable Development Goals in Nigeria 
To be written 
Tips of the Iceberg 
The oil spill pattern along pipeline is part of an expanding network of oil spill incidents in 
Nigeria In the NigerDelta alone oil spills occur in both terrestrial and marine environments that 
threatens landuse and landcover biodiversity wildlife and human security At present oil spill 
in the NigerDelta is a major cause of contaminated land food insecurity surface and groundwater 
pollution vegetation farming sediment air pollution public health and human wellbeing 
industry conspiracy and institutional conflicts  Unless environmental monitoring tools developed 
with geovisualization and geoanalytical capabilities are developed to implement environmental 
safeguards are developed the spatial impacts of oil spill will not be identified understood and 
contextualised in a wider framework such the SDGs…
