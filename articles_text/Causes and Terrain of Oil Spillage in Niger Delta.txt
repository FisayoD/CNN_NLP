Abstract 
The work analyzed the effects of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production in Delta Central Agricultural Zone of Delta State 
Nigeria  The specific objective of this study are to “describe the socio – economic characteristics of the respondents to identify 
agricultural production activities of the respondents to identify causes of oil spillagepollution of the area and to describe the effects of 
oil spillage on agricultural production activities of its respondents A simple random sampling technique was used to select a sample of 
115 respondents for the study Data collected through questionnaire were analyzed using percentage presented in tables Result shows 
that oil spillage pollution occurred as a result of corrosion of oil pipelines and explosion of oil wellsterminalstations giving rise to 
unproductive soil reducing the people interest in agricultural activities However some recommendation were made the first 
recommendation “a permanent disaster management institution should be established in this area the second recommendation was “oil 
companies should engage in preventative measure to mitigate the risk of oil spillage pollution as well as ensuring transparency with 
regard to payment of compensation contract to affected communities

Introduction   
The exploration and exploitation of crude oil has brought with it several cases of oil pollution leading to depletion of natural 
resources Nigeria the most populous country in Africa is also one of the best endowed in terms of natural resources Since 1974 
only 14 years after her independence oil production for export has been by far the main source of revenue for the government Today 
oil sales account for more than 40percent of GDP 80 percent of the government’s budgetary revenue and more than 95 percent of 
exports With an average production of approximately 2 million barrels per day Nigeria is one of the world’s largest oil producers 
Oyinlola and Olamiju 2013  The Niger Delta Region belongs to the SouthSouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria It is the most 
endowed delta in the world in terms of both human and material resources Before the discovery of crude oil agriculture was the 
dominant occupation of the people Crude oil was discovered in commercial quantity in the region specifically in the present Bayelsa 
State in 1956 Since then oil exploration has continued resulting into what is termed environmental destruction due to neglect and 
negative attitude of the multinational companies in environmental management in the area  
 
Crude oil and gas production is the main stay of the Nigeria economy contributing about 90 of the nation’s foreign exchange 80 
of total government revenue earning and 25 of the gross domestic product GDP Niger Delta Development Commission 2006 
Crude oil and gas pollution is the major environmental hazard caused by crude oil and gas exploration exploitation and production in 
the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and many parts of the world Ward et al 2003 Benson and Etesin 2008 Kuhad and Gupta 2009 
Rashid et al 2010 Wang et al 2010 Crude oil and gas pollution can occur in form of spillages due to oil well blowout corrosion of  
pipelines accidental discharges and vandalisation These oil spillages can lead to underground leakages which have impacts on the 
environment in the form of underground water pollution  soil pollution Ikhajiagbe and Anoliefo 2011 health  effect Chukwu and 
Lawal 2010 Jain et al 2011 Shrivastava 2011 and destruction of vegetation Alam et al 2010  
 
The world today recognizes the significance of environmental sustainability to the development of the nations In fact one of the 
cardinal objectives of the Millennium Development Goals is to ensure environmental sustainability It then implies that there should 
be reduction in environmental pollution Eregha and Irughe 2009 The Niger Delta region is Nigeria’s only productive region for 
petroleum The region consists entirely of nine states of Rivers Bayelsa Cross Rivers Akwa Ibom Delta Edo Ondo Abia and Imo 
As is the case with many oilrich developing countries oil reserves have proved a mixed blessing for Nigeria This is so because of the 
environmental and social impacts exploration and exploitation of this important natural resource Amu 2006 The Niger Delta region

is dominated by rural communities that depend solely on the natural environment for sustenance living and nonliving livelihood 
UNDP Report 2006 Environmental degradation issues are of topical concern to communities in the Niger Delta as it is a major 
cause of productivity losses Opukri and Ibaba 2008 This is the main reason why oil and gas extraction impact on the NigerDelta 
has consequences for the declining productivity of the region which is predominantly based on fisheries and other agricultural 
activities as farming and timber businesses Oil production has definitely worsened environmental disaster in the region Worgu 
2000  Delta State which is one of the nine 9 States in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is greatly endowed with abundant natural 
resources and a weather which supports all year round agricultural production  
 
 
According to FOS 1995 about 50 percent of the active labour force is engaged in one form of agricultural activity or another with 
yam cassava plantain maize cocoyam and vegetables as the predominant food crops in the area However owing to the 
hydrographic conditions of the State only a fraction of the land size is cultivated with crops Cropping patterns are mainly sole 
cropping mixed cropping and intercropping while farming practices are traditional and the use of crude implements such as hoe and 
cutlasses predominate Agricultural production is on a small and subsistence scale with small farm holdings  Mechanization is on a 
very low scale and the use of modern farming inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides is limited because farmers hardly have access to 
it since it is nationally distributed by the Federal Government   Delta State is the largest crude oil producing State in Nigeria located 
in the Niger delta region the base of the Nigerian oil and gas industry which generates over 90 percent of the nation’s foreign 
exchange earnings  
 
Paradoxically in spite of the increasing revenue from crude oil exploitation the communities from which this resource flows in the 
Niger Delta continue to live in conditions of social deprivation and abject poverty All stages of oil exploitation impact negatively on 
the environment and the greatest single intractable environmental problem caused by crude oil exploration in the Niger Delta region is 
oil spillage According to the DPR 1997 over 6000 spills had been recorded in the 40 years of oil exploitation in Nigeria with an 
average of 150 spills per annum In the period 1976 – 1996 647 incidents occurred resulting in the spillage of 236940704 barrels of 
crude oil With only 54906038 barrels recovered 182041050 barrels of oil were lost to the ecosystem 
 
The people of Delta region prior to the discovery of oil made their living from exploitation of the resources of the land water and 
forest as farmers fishermen and hunters conscious of the critical position of the environment to their sustenance and their future 
generations the people of the zone were very attached to their environment The discovery of oil understandably raised the hopes of 
the people for development in their innocence they believed that the Nigerian state and the oil companies were equally interested In 
and committed to their development they soon found out that this was not the case and that the two shared a common interest in the 
maximization of profit and the accumulation of capital at any cost hardly their welfare or development Owugah 2009 therefore with 
the discovery of oil in the area all activities including agricultural pursuit became peripheral and subservient to oil exploration 
activities as has been extensively mentioned above 
            
In the zone community oil spills are a direct consequence of crude oil production and therefore manmade they may also result in 
changes to both the landscape and the socioeconomic activities in the area spills may also result because of faults at any stage of the 
production and movement of crude as products involve many mechanical processes the continued efficiency of which may not be 
guaranteed Jike 2007 has argued rather trenchantly that although oil companies have made enormous profit in the country these 
companies have contributed minimally to the country’s development 
           
In the same vein communities oil spills have posed a major threat to the environment which has led to total annihilation of the 
ecosystem thus life in this area is becoming increasingly unbearable due to the ugly effects of oil spills Oyem 2011 Intermittent oil 
spillage has rendered vast stretch of indigenous farmlands useless therefore as important as oil might seem to the nation’s economy 
the people perceive the discovery of oil as threat to their life support system the landThis particular oil spill has a serious impact on 
the vegetation and wildlife to the extent that plants could no longer bear its traditional faults and those making a living from the sea 
resources were stranded thus in most cases such damage is temporary and is caused primarily by the physical properties of oil 
creating nuisance and hazardous conditions the impact of this oil spills has also led to situation where the  people who have been 
known to be friends of their environment used raffia palms bamboo and other forest resources to make their houses now they are 
forced to use cement and corrugated iron sheets for their houses this is because there are no longer healthy forest and swamp 
resources for building their conventional and convenient houses many of the plants and the tree spices have died off which others are 
largely dwarfed as a result of the highly toxic ecosystem in which they now find themselves 
 
The broad objective of this study is to “analyze the effects of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production in Delta Central 
Agricultural Zone of Delta State” The specific objectives are to a Describe the socio – economic characteristics of the respondents 
b Identify agricultural production activities of the respondents c Identify causes of oil spillagepollution of the area d Describe the 
effect of oil spillagepollution in agricultural production activities of its respondents

Methodology 
The study was conducted in Delta State which lies in the southsouth part of Nigeria Delta ADP DADP for administrative 
convenience divided the state into three agricultural zones Delta North Agricultural zone with 9 extension blocks Delta central zone 
with 10 extension blocks and Delta South Zone with 6 extension blocks  A multistaged random sampling technique was used for the 
study because the sampling units occur in strata of blocks and cells Deltacentral which has its headquarters in Effurun has ten local 
governments under it with most of them Urohbos by tribe This area of the state suffers from spillover of militant activities from the 
highly volatile deltasouth zone This is where the amnesty camp for the rehabilitation of the militants is located The first stage was 
the purposive selection of Delta Central zone being oil spill area and has the largest extension blocks  10 extension blocks of the total 
25 extension blocks and with the largest concentration of food crop farmers This was followed by a random selection of five blocks 
Ughelli North Sapele Ethiope East Isoko North and Udu blocks respectively from the ten blocks in the Delta central zone The 
third stage was the random selection of two cells from eight cells in each block to make a total of ten cells sampled The last stage was 
the random selection of 12 farmers from each cell which are mainly ADP registered farmers A total of 120 farmers formed the 
sample name but only 115 copies of respondents’ questionnaires were useful for analysis The two main sources of data used for this 
study was primary and secondary data The primary data was collected from the field survey using questionnaire Simple statistical 
tool such as mean percentage frequency distribution was used to analyze objective 1234  
 
 
 Results and Discussion 
Socio Economic Characteristics of the Respondents  
Table 1 shows that 435 of the respondents are between the age brackets of 51 – 60 years They are followed by 296 of the 
respondents who are between the ages of 41 50 years while 174 and 148 of the respondents are over 60years and between 3140 
years The mean age from the distribution is 418 years this implies that the respondents had been in agricultural production for a long 
time and must have had experiences on the effects of oil spillagepollution Table 1 also shows that 652 are males while 348 of 
the respondents are females This implies that majority of males in the study area are involve in agricultural production than the 
female because they are heads of families Furthermore 739 of the respondents are married 156 are divorced while 104 are 
widows This implies that majority of people who are involved in agricultural production are married  The table shows that 539 of 
the respondents have secondary education followed by 330 that have primary education 104 has tertiary education while 26 
of the respondent have no formal education This result revealed that majority had formal education hence could read and write The 
table  revealed that 383 of the respondents have a household size of 46 followed by 339 of respondents with household size of 
79 243 of respondents with household size  of 1 3 while 35 of the respondents have a household size  of above 10 The mean 
household size of the respondents in the study area is 48 persons This implies that greater numbers of people who are involved in 
agricultural production serve as labour Majority 47 of the respondents have been in farming business between 11 – 20years 
287 of the respondents have been in farming practices above 21years and the mean farm experience was 114years This implies 
that the respondents had engaged on agricultural production for longer time and must have had several experiences on the effects of 
oil spillagepollution on agricultural production in the study area On farm size 557 of the respondents have between 05 1 hectares 
of land followed by 31 3 that has between 15 2 hectares 104 have between 253 hectares while 26 of the respondents have 
35 hectares and above  
 
Agricultural Production Activities of the Respondents  
Table 2 shows the agricultural production activities of the respondents the table shows that 940 of the respondents engage in 
cassava production followed by 887 engaged in fish production 852 engage in yam production 391 engage in cocoyam 
production 304 are engaged in agric business 261 are both engaged in poultry production and Goat rearing and while 226 of 
the respondents are engage in sheep rearing The meaning is that the respondents are farmers 
 
Causes of Oil Spillage Pollution in the Study Area  
Table 3 shows the causes of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production by the respondents It shows that 940 of respondents 
agree to both explosion of oil wellsterminalstations and corrosion of oil pipelines as causes to oil spillagepollution on agricultural 
production followed by 870 of the respondents agree to  drilling of oil wells as cause 826 of the respondents agree for spills 
from vandalized oil pipelines leakage from oil tanksfaulty facility and spills from loading oil vessels as causes 800 of the 
respondents agree to maintenance activities of oil companies as cause 748 of the respondents agree to natural gas flaring as cause 
while 678 of the respondents agree to sabotage as one of the causes of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production  The above 
is in line with Oyem 2011 who posited that thousand of barrel of oil have been let loose into the environment through corrosion of 
oil pipeline and explosion of oil well in the country  This loss is basically as a result of lack of maintenance of pipelines storage 
tanks most pipelines from the flow stations are obsolete according to the international standard oil pipes ought to be replaced after 15 
to 20 years but most pipelines in use are 20 to 25 years old making them subject to corrosion and leakage some of these pipes are 
laid above ground level without adequate surveillance exposing them to wear and tear and other dangers  
 
Badejo and Nwilo 2004 noted that illegal fuel siphoning as a result of the thriving black market for fuel products has increased the 
number of oil pipelines explosion in recent years

Effects of Oil SpillagePollution on the Agricultural Production Activities   
 
Table 4 show the effect of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production by the respondents From the table 957 of the 
respondents agreed that reduction of soil fertility increased soil temperaturetoxicity low land productivity poor yield and death of 
fishes are effects of oil spillagepollution on agricultural production Again 922 of the respondents agreed that destruction of soil 
microorganism stunted growth of crop and failure wilting of crop toxicity water available for livestock and outbreak of crop disease 
852  degradation of farm land destruction of soil structure bad taste of produce and death of livestock are effects if oil pollution  
Other effects are contamination of waterriver sources  crop leaves appear burnt poor soil aeration of farm land yellowing of crop 
leaves and rotting of yam and cassava tubers

The above findings are in line with Irhivben and Omonona 2013 who said that the effect of oil in aquatic system is perilous it 
distorts the beach aesthetics and depletes fishery potentials it also impact on water productivity and human health like in terrestrial oil 
pollution  the initial impact of oil on aquatic system manifest in the suffocation of native biotic communities due to the body of the oil 
covering water surfaces in such a way that primary producer and higher species in the food chain become impacted Regarding 
livestock production in the state oil exploration has impacted negatively as vegetation in most land of the state suffered poor growth 
due to oil spillage effect The resultant effect of this implication is that there are few grazing lands that could account for the feeding 
of animals in the state apart vegetations available are loaded with chemicals and poisonous substances that are both detrimental to 
animal health and human lives

Conclusion 
The causes of the oil spillagepollution are drilling of oil wells explosion of oil wellsterminalsstation spills from vandalized oil 
pipelines leakages from oil tanksfaulty facility corrosion of oil pipelines spills from loading oil vessels maintenance activities of oil 
companies natural causes flaring sabotage The effects of oil spills  pollution includes reduction of soil fertility poor soil creation of 
farm land degradation of farm land increased soil temperaturetoxicity destruction of soil microorganisms destruction of soil 
structure low land productivity yellowing of crop leaves stunted growth of crop crop failure poor yield of crop rotting tubers 
wilting of crop toxicity water available for livestock deaths of fishes contamination of waterriver sources crop leaves appear burnt 
bad taste of produce outbreak of crop disease death of livestock Government should establish a permanent disaster management 
institution in this area as none has existed there previously The oil companies should engage in preventative measures to mitigate or 
minimize the risk of oil spillage like investing the adequate and regular maintenances of their oil installations and the replacing of old 
pipes as well as improving the security agencies guarding their various installations to prevent the vandalization of pipelines 
Government must play a leading role by enacting and enforcing environment law which include the load use act EIA decree and the 
petroleum and Distribution act that will protect the oil producing communities as well as guarantee the affected communities of a 
better livelihood
