Abstract
The Niger Delta region is the oil producing area of Nigeria which consists of highly diverse
ecosystems that are supportive of numerous species of terrestrial and aquatic fauna and
flora Crude oil spills endanger fish hatcheries in coastal water and also contaminate valu
able fish This study examines the effects of oil spills on fish production in the Niger Delta of
Nigeria from 1981–2015 using an estimable Cobb Douglas production function The findings
suggest that oil production and spills negatively affect fish production while farm labour has
a positive effect on fish production On the other hand fishery loan exerts a negative effect
on fish production and this could be ascribed to the bottlenecks in accessing these loans
This study corroborates the findings in literature on the negative concomitance of oil spills
and fish production and suggests a cautious approach to oil exploration activities for a sus
tainable development in the region
Introduction
In the Niger Delta oil spill is perceived to be a major consequence of an inordinate exploita
tion of petroleum resources in the region Some recent studies have examined spatial varia
tions in the natural mortality of particular fish species in order to assess the impact of oil spills
on marine ecosystems specifically in the Arctic area 1 2 – 3 But varying results from these
studies indicate the resistance of fish species to the toxicity of the environment However this
study examines oil spills as a major environmental problem that hampers fish production
drawing from econometric techniques of the CobbDouglas production function ignoring
spatial variations due to data constraints Above all we seek to ascertain a statistical relation
ship and suggest possible policy implications for a sustainable economic environment for
increasing fish production and food sufficiency in one of the most degraded areas in the
world This study differs from previous research on environmental degradation in the Niger
Delta and implications on agricultural productivity by specifically examining fish production
from the perspective of analysing data on fresh water fishing
The Niger Delta is the major oil producing region of Nigeria which is located by the Atlantic
Coast where River Niger divides into numerous tributaries The region is known to be the sec
ond largest delta in the world of about 450 kilometres of coast line that terminates at the Imo

River entrance 4 This region spans through 20000 square kilometres and has been described
as the largest wetland in Africa and among the three largest in the world consisting about 2370
square kilometres of rivers creeks and estuaries and stagnant swamp covering about 8600
square kilometres 5 – 6 This highly diverse ecosystem supports numerous species of aquatic
flora and fauna and terrestrial life 7 describes the Niger Delta area as the one of the richest
wetlands in the world The exploitation of oil in the Niger Delta region has brought to bear oil
spillage and its numerous problems Such problems include contamination of water bodies
danger to aquatic life and destruction of farmlands 8 According to 8 between 1976 and
1996 it was estimated that over 6000 oil spills occurred in the Niger Delta region and about
2million barrels of crude oil leaked into the environment This calls for serious concern know
ing that this ecosystem is a major source of livelihood for the inhabitants of the region
Oil was first discovered in the region in 1956 and since the early 1970s oil has dominated
the country’s economy Oil exploration has over the years impacted negatively on the physical
environment of the oilbearing communities 9 10 observes that oil exploitation has
increased the rate of environmental degradation and has perpetuated food insecurity as a
result of death of fish and crops as well as loss of farm lands and viable rivers for fishing activi
ties leading to loss of livelihood There is no doubt that the disastrous effect of oil spill impedes
agricultural productivity and fishing to be specific which in the longrun has an adverse con
sequence on the economic life of the inhabitants of this region 11 9 Furthermore studying
the prospects and challenges of environmental impact of oil exploration in the Niger Delta
region of Nigeria and the remediation of contaminated lands in the region 12 argues that
resolving the technical dilemma of the cleanup mechanism and identifying social impedi
ments will be the key success driver of the United Nations Environmental Programme action
plan which was recently adopted by the government of Nigeria for the cleanup of the Niger
Delta The study further recommends that bioremediation should be adopted considering its
low greenhouse effect and the reduced cost burden on the weak and overstretched economy of
Nigeria The motivation for this study draws from the increasing importance of fish to the eco
nomic life of this region and the country at large with the attendant negative effect of oil
exploration activities In this study we provide specific answers to the problem of environ
mental degradation through oil spills on fish production in the Niger Delta region by applying
econometric techniques Also the effect of positive actions such as agricultural credit to fisher
men is considered as an explanatory variable to reduce omitted variable bias This study is pre
sented in six sections the second is a review of related literature the third is a presentation of
stylized facts while the fourth section discusses the method of analysis fifth is the interpreta

Literature review
Studies on the impact of oil spills on fish production are becoming increasing important not
only because it provides the basis for understanding the reprehensible activities of oil explora
tion but uncovers the ideological and intellectual perspective of the relationship between oil
spills and environmental degradation 13 14 15 16 examines the environmental impact of
oil exploration and exploitation in Niger Delta of Nigeria using tabular analysis of data obtained
from secondary sources The study finds that the oil industry sited within this region has con
tributed enormously to the economic growth of the country but unsustainable oil exploration
activities have rendered the Niger Delta region one of the five most severely damaged ecosys
tems in the World Nevertheless 17 assessed oil exploration and spillage in the Niger Delta
region of the country using comparative analysis of secondary data covering periods from 1976
to 2000 on descriptive techniques such as line and bar graphs and found a decrease in oil

spillage quantity but an increase in the number and times of oil spill On the other hand the
findings in 15 provides evidence for the decrease in agricultural yield over the period follow
ing persistent environmental degradation due to oil spills and oil pipeline vandalization
18 estimates the effects of oil pollution on crop production in Rivers State Nigeria on a
sample of 296 respondents drawn from 17 out of 23 Local Government Areas applied a stochas
tic translog production function in a multistage sampling technique The results indicate that
the effect of crude oil pollution on crop farms reduced the size of farmland significantly at 1
reducing marginal physical product MPP while in nonpolluted farms output increased
Physical inputs crude oil pollution variables and their interactions show strong negative
diminishing returns to scale in oil polluted farms but in nonpolluted farmlands result indi
cate strong positive returns to scale The technical efficiency results show that less than 22 of
crop farmers were over 80 efficient in their use of resources in oil polluted farmlands while
technical efficiency in nonpolluted farmlands indicates a high efficiency of 33 This result
indicates that environmental degradation poses a serious threat to farmers by diminishing both
physical ability and psychological desires to farm The goal of farming may be defeated before
the proper exercise especially when the individual has no hope of any compensation when the
crops are destroyed or the waters are polluted as always the case in the Niger delta region
19 critically assessed the effect of oil exploration on poverty in the Niger Delta region of
Nigeria The author’s extensive review of the literature and drawing conclusion from the
empirical findings restate the neglect of the region and the consequences of pollution as a
drawback to economic progress The study further concludes that the greatest negative ten
dency associated with the exploration and exploitation of oil in this region is environmental
degradation However a recent study by 20 suggests soil screening and massive cleanup
funding to enhance contaminated land legislation The efforts of government in the recently
commissioned cleanup exercise of affected areas in the Niger Delta could not be ascertained
but given the importance of oil exploration and exploitation to the Nigerian economy one
would expect that this initiative will yield positive results
21 examined oil pollution and agricultural productivity in the Niger Delta of Nigeria the
study employed an empirical analysis derived from a unique estimable production function
based on Ramon Lopez’s Cobb Douglas production function model Findings established that
increasing levels of oil spill and forest loss negatively affect agricultural productivity while
land labour and capital positively improved agricultural productivity in the Niger Delta In
the same vein 22 explore the environmental effects of petroleum activities and policies in
Nigeria employing descriptive techniques to attain logical interpretations Findings from this
study revealed that the actions of oil companies operating in the Niger Delta have tremendous
influence on the survival of ecosystems and biodiversity of the region In a similar study 23
investigates the consequences of oil spill on seafood safety in coastal areas of Ibeno Akwa
Ibom State observed the mean concentration of toxic petroleum hydrocarbons in the tissues
of various fish species sample to be increasing as a result of oil spills Investigating the impact
of petroleum activities on various episodes of economic crisis in Nigeria 11 24 evaluates the
historical pattern of oil spills using a descriptive technique to analyse data obtained from sec
ondary sources and affirming that the transmogrification of the economy from agricultural
based to petroleumbased laid the foundation for the current economic crisis in Nigeria Also
25 while exploring the extent of environmental degradation in Niger Delta region and exam
ining the efforts of oil companies in remediating the degraded farmlands in Niger Delta finds
that oil pollution causes damage to human health agricultural land and fish ponds as well as
longstanding ecological malfunctioning

observed that gas flaring has a statistically significant but dangerous impact on human health
in the affected areas giving the high temperature and emission to the atmosphere Nonetheless
the problem of illegal bunkering and vandalizing petroleum pipelines contribute immensely to
oil spillage and degradation of the environment 27 observes that oftentimes illegal bunker
ing and petroleum pipeline vandalization results from destructive tendencies of restive youths
who were aggrieved by government neglect of oil producing communities and corruption of
the ruling class in amassing wealth through collaborations with oil companies 28 Unfortu
nately these social vices perpetrated by the youths have a countereffect in increasing the level
of oil spills on the environment and the negative effect on water and land agricultural produce
Also 29 analyse the influence of petroleum on Nigerian economy using secondary annual
data from 2000 to 2009 The technique employed for the analysis include linear regression
model and found that petroleum has substantial direct influence on the economy Unfortu
nately the mismanagement of the proceeds from petroleum exploration imbues Nigeria into
the resource curse dilemma 28 30 Given the present circumstances in the Niger Delta and
the need for improved economic activities for the population it becomes very imperative for
studies to explore the impact of environmental degradation on specific issues such as fish pro
duction to enable policy makers pinpoint areas of concentration in the implementation of
various policies for the economic development of the region
Recent quantitative assessments of oil spills on fish production for other regions especially
in the Arctic categorized fish in two distinct ways 3 described the pelagic and demersal fish
as varying with respect to their natural habitat and the impact of oil spills The study contends
that while the pelagic and fish eggs may come into direct contact with oil spill the demersal
fish does not easily come into contact with spilled oil except it spills deep into the sea bed
However prolonged spills may inhibit the survivability of the demersal fish to avoid spilled oil
by swimming away from danger zone The implication is that if a spill is allowed to spread it
permeates deep down to the sea bed over a long period causing more harm to the environ
ment which in turn affects fish production In the same vein 1 assessing the impact of simu
lated oil spills on the Northeast Arctic Cod fishery finds a spatial regeneration of fish
population In all simulations the adult fish population remained at full reproductive potential
with a reasonable number of juveniles swimming to replace the old fish population Neverthe
less the variation in age of the fish determines the rate of survival following the impact of an
oil spill The study concludes that the reproductive health of the adult fish population is not
affected in all simulations However the results provide the necessary insights to assist in the
management of oil spills on fisheries
Another very compelling study 2 using data from the Northeast Arctic cod to estimate
spatial variations in natural mortality segregates studies on the impact of oil spills on fish
into retrospective and prospective studies While the former investigates the impact of a
spill the later estimates the probable outcome of potential future oil spills In this case the
prospective study finds that spatial variation in natural mortality can alter the impact of an
oilspill on fish However in this study we have employed the retrospective dimension to
analyse the effects of oil spill on fish production in the Niger Delta Here we strongly aver to
the contrary on the assertion in 2 that scientific studies on the impact of oil spills on fish
stocks tend to ignore the fact that spatial patterns of natural mortality may influence the
magnitude of the impact over time To this end we apply parametric CobbDouglas pro
duction function on fish production and oil spill data assuming that oil spills kill fish at the
egg or larval stage and at maturity The oil spill risk assessment is based on a probability of
constant mortality rate for all fish categories hence the spatial variability is difficult to esti
mate given the paucity of data

Stylized facts
The extent of oil spillage
Oil spill incidents have occurred at different times along the Niger Delta area From the records
of the Department of Petroleum Resources DPR 31 – 32 within the period 1976–2015 a
total no of 16476 spills occurred at different occasions and a total quantity of approximately 3
million barrels spilled into the environment Unfortunately more than 70 was not recovered
69 of these spills occurred offshore a quarter was in swamps and 6 spilled on land 33
In 34 the record from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC indicates
that the amount of crude oil spilled into the Niger Delta is estimated at 2300 cubic metres on
average over 300 spills occurred every year from 1975 to 1995 In contrast the World Bank
provides figures 5 – 6 which estimates oil spill to the environment at almost ten times the
NNPC figures arguing that the official figures ignore the so called “minor” spills In the same
vein 8 categorically describes the largest individual spills to include the blowout of a Texaco
offshore station in 1980 which dumped an estimated 400000 barrels 64000 m3 of crude oil
into the Gulf of Guinea and Royal Dutch Shell Forcado Terminal tank failure with an esti
mated spillage of 580000 barrels 92000 m3 35 has modestly estimated the quantity of
petroleum products and crude oil spilled in the Niger Delta through oil exploration activities
as falling between 9 million and 13 million barrels
Methodology

This study employs time series data from 1981 to 2015 sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria
Statistical Bulletin 2015 Department of Petroleum Resources 2016 and Food and Agricul
tural Organisation 2017 statistical bulletin The data for fish production measured in tonnes
and fishery loan and labour was obtained from Food and Agricultural Organization The data

model for the purpose of estimation The usefulness of this transformation includes minimiza
tion of the huge differences in the magnitude of different variables thereby bringing out the
coefficient of covariation better and the explanation of the results in the form of elasticity

Estimation techniques
This study employs econometric technique to assess the relation
ship between oil spills and fish production among other associated variables The descriptive
method consists of trend graphs as shown in Figs 1 2 and 3 The trends of oil spillage and fish
production explains the behaviour of the variables from 1981 to 2015 The scope captures the
dynamics of the explanatory variables and the effects on fish production in the Niger Delta
region The econometric methods adopted include Augmented Dickey Fuller Stationarity test
Johansen cointegration test Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square FMOLS and Pairwise
Granger Causality Test This study employed the Augmented Dickey Fuller unit root to test for
stationarity of variables because most time series are nonstationary at their levels Cointegra
tion is used to test for long run relationship between the dependent variable and the indepen
dent variables Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares is used to estimate the long run effect of
the independent variables on the dependent variables after correcting for the endogeneity prob
lem in the time series and Pairwise Granger Causality Test

time series data are conducted to stabilize the mean variance and autocorrelation properties
that are presumed to be unstable over time The cointegration and error correction specifica
tions are obtained in order to elicit statistical relationships between variables and a Granger
causality test determines if there exists a causal link between oil spills and fish production and
the direction of causation
Stationarity test
The decision rule for the Augmented Dickey Fuller ADF Unit root
test states that the PP Test statistic value must be greater than the Critical Value at 5 absolute
terms for stationarity to be established at level and if otherwise differencing occurs using the
same decision rule 36 Thus the summary of results of the Augmented Dickey Fuller ADF
unit root presented in Table 1 below shows that all the variables are stationary after first differ
ence This implies that the variables are all integrated at order one symbolized as I 1
Cointegration test The cointegration test establishes whether a longrun equilibrium
relationship exist among the variables of interest Since the unit root test revealed that all the
variables are integrated of order 1 Johansen Cointegration test can be applied
Test of cointegration hypothesis
H0 φ = 0 No cointegrating equation

The results of unrestricted trace cointegrating rank test suggest that the null hypothesis H0
of no cointegrating equation is rejected and suggests the presence of one cointegrating equa
tion at 5 percent significance level Also the unrestricted maxeigen cointegrating rank test
rejects the null hypothesis H0 of no cointegrating equation and suggests the presence of one
cointegrating equation at 5 percent significance level as shown in Table 2 Hence we con
clude that both unrestricted trace cointegrating rank test and unrestricted maxeigen cointe
grating rank test confirmed the presence of cointegrating equation Hence there is a long run

Using this concept we fail to reject the null hypothesis that fish production does not
Granger cause the number of times oil is spilled on the environment since its Pvalue 030 is
greater than 005 significance level see Table 4 However as shown in Table 4 we reject the
null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis which states that the number of times
oil is spilled on the environment affect the level of fish production thus we make a case of uni
directional relationship arguing that the number of times oil is spilled influences the level of
fish production in the Niger Delta of Nigeria Worthy of note is that causality in the Granger
sense does not significantly imply correlation of oils spills and fish production in the Niger
Delta Nonetheless we exercise caution in the fact that other seasonal factors may determine
changes in the quantity of fish produced in the region A statistical relationship of causation
does not necessarily imply correlation but in this case we see a subjective pattern that war
rants the conclusion drawn for this study
Discussion of results
This study confirms the adverse effect of increase in oil spills on fish production in the Niger
delta region of Nigeria Oil spills are usually due to continuous incidence of vandalism and
corrosion of oil pipelines which destroy aquatic life and pollute the environment such that
agricultural activities become impossible in the affected areas The longterm effect of an oil
spill incidence is usually associated with a reduction in crop yield and death of fish This study
corroborates the findings in 21 that oil spill is a major impediment to agricultural activities
in the Niger Delta region of the country In addition it provides an empirical impetus for the
findings in 38 for the management of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites in Nigeria
Nevertheless several studies have shown that the pollution caused by oil spillage does not end
with the mopping up of the spilled oil in the land area or water 39 It is now known that
health risk is not averted by abstinence from fish killed by spilled oil Some of the fishes and
animals that escape instant death from pollution are known to have taken in some of the toxic

tions on man coupled with other “side effects in form of genetic mutations” 40 – 41 There is
strong scientific proof that fish is a major indicator for environmental contamination provid
ing evidence for transmission of pollutants in marine ecosystems 33
In fact oil activity depresses fish production in the long run because of the unwholesome
environmental degradation that accompany exploration of crude oil in the region Oil driven
environmental factors affecting fishing activities include gas flaring oil well blowouts and
improper disposal of drilling mud and pipeline leakages as observed in 42 and in 20 sug
gesting the prioritisation of sites for the cleanup exercise in the Niger Delta region equally
noting that high risk areas may not necessary imply the most contaminated zones but based
on the observed levels of hydrocarbon contamination and importance of the zone to the liveli
hood of the inhabitants
Furthermore this study finds that more labour involvement in fish production improves
fish outputs in the region exerting a positive and substantial influence on fish production Sus
tainable improvement in agricultural sector requires skilled and ablebodied youths to engage
in the agricultural process This would drastically increase agricultural outputs in the country
providing jobs for the unemployed youths and reducing incidence of restiveness in the region
However credit to fish farmers through the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Funds
ACGSF exert negligible inverse and insignificant effect on fish outputs in the long run This
finding confirms the outcome of the studies by 43–46 that the Agricultural Credit Guarantee
Scheme Fund ACGSF has no significant impact on agricultural production This may be as a
result of some challenges affecting the effectiveness of the scheme Some of the challenges
include a high rate of loan default by farmers lack of full cooperation by participating banks
This study also supports the assertion that the nature of operating equipment used by the
oil companies including pipeline vandalization by errant youths of the region are contributory
factors to the number of oil spills on the environment which constitute a setback to fish pro
duction and agricultural productivity resulting from the destruction of the environment This
result is in tandem with the observation in 10 on the socioeconomic consequences of oil spill
on the environment recommending an improvement in the infrastructure and equipment in
order to prevent oil spills and the attendant youth restiveness resulting from deprivation
Conclusion
This study concludes that there is a tradeoff between oil exploitation activities and fish produc
tion due to the effect of oil spills We demonstrate that increasing levels of oil spillage and oil
production negatively affects fish production in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria However
changes in fish production may be stimulated by other seasonal and environmental factors not
accounted for in our model of estimation Frankly incidence of oil spills among other environ
mental factors depress agricultural outputs particularly fishing Also agricultural interventions
in Nigeria such as Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund ACGSF failed to substantially
improve fish production in Nigeria Furthermore labour input in fishing agricultural subsector
can be employed towards improving productivity in the subsector A major policy implication
arising from the empirical evidence in this study is the need for an enhanced social protection
policy for the inhabitants of the Niger Delta because providing credit for agricultural purposes
may not yield significant results because of the short supply of arable land for cultivation and
clean water for the survival of an aquatic ecosystem In the same vein since most of these river
ine communities are traditionally into peasant fish production a destruction of the habitat
completely dispossesses them of their productive capacity This informs why there is a high loan

default amongst loan recipients The inhabitants of this region need to be educated on the pro
cess of commercial fishing that is required for the repayment of loans
The Department of Petroleum Resources should enforce policies on pipeline life span dura
tion in order to reduce corrosion of pipelines The adoption of the Special Partnership Frame
work SPF will help significantly in reducing oilinduced environmental diseconomies in the
Niger Delta including secondround consequences that undermine peace in the region which
adversely affects both oil and agricultural outputs Improved pipeline quality and monitoring
would also lessen the incidence of vandalism
On the other hand government should be prompt in the cleanup of the affected areas by
enacting and enforcing stringent environmental laws that will protect oil producing areas
Government should be able to identify natural resources such as wetlands and coastal zones
in Nigeria and monetary investment in environmental protection of vulnerable areas should
be seriously considered There should be an operating standard for the examination of the
existing water quality and monitoring in addition to active monitoring and evaluation systems
for waterrelated projects and services in the region
Finally we recommend the establishment of a framework for collaboration through train
ing and financial support by government to strengthen environmental agencies and organiza
tions in their role as watchdog for ensuring the exchange of information especially for high
risk oil extracting activities
