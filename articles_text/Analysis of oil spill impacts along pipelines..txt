Abstract The grave challenges of oil pollution have been over stated in several 
environmental journals Similarly there have been several discourses on the 
prevailing nature of Nigerian oil spill pollution Alarmingly the spills seem to 
have persisted despite existing legislations sanctioning them making it seem as 
if there was no legislation sanctioning such pollution activities abinitio Scholars 
state that the environmental pollution and degradation that has emanated from 
oil spill in Nigeria has led to the destruction of landscape loss of arable farm
lands aesthetic environment fishing operations revenue and sometime lives 
This article shall therefore review the current legislation to identify their defi
ciencies as well as the perceived inability of the Petroleum Industries Bill PIB 
to effectively enforce against deliberate pollution

Introduction 
The ideal of environmental protection forms a 
core basis for the discussions in this article To 
proceed we would posit to wit that whether in 
Nigeria or elsewhere the discussions on sanc
tioning as a principle of environmental law 
hinges on a justification as to why there should 
be sanctions in the first instance Thus it is trite 
to inquire if and why there is even a need to pro
tect the environment  
A consensual protection of the ecosystem has 
been viewed as the only solution to the global en
vironmental challenges Oks 2015 Hence not 
only are all of earth’s resources finite they are 
also important for continued functionality of 
planet earth and are interconnected with each 
other The above position tallies with the view of 
some other environmental schools to wit that 
the need for environmental protection stems 
from the critical issues of maintaining good hu
man health Chartered Institute of Environmen
tal Health 2017 eliminating or at least curbing 
the notorious global warming and climate 
change challenge reducing the depletion of 
earth’s finite resources Mensah and Castro 
2014 and the fact that matters of environmen
tal concern are integral to other aspects of life 
and societal construction such as policy and po
litical concepts Scotford 2017 
It is therefore deducible from the foregoing that 
while environmental protection is the basis for 
environmental law it also maintains necessary 
harmony with the other subjects of life that 
might be affected by environmental issues In ad
dition the formulation of effective legislation re
mains a key challenge for many governments  
For this article “effectiveness” as adopted from 
the English Oxford online dictionaries 2017 
means “the degree to which something is success
ful in producing a desired result success” It there
fore implies that a legislation can only be deemed 
effective when it has succeeded in the purpose 
for its enactment Similarly “sanctioning” as 
adopted from the MerriamWebster online dic
tionary 2017 means “a mechanism of social 
control for enforcing a societys standards” Relat
ing these concepts to Nigeria it would therefore 
be expected that legislation set out to sanction

pollution in Nigeria’s oil sector would have failed 
to be effective if despite the presence of such 
seeming legislation oil pollution continues un
deterred   
 
Pollution in Nigeria’s Oil Sector 
Pollution sources in Nigeria include industrial 
plants of manufacturing organizations domestic 
household wastes and other decomposing waste 
solid mineral mining activities as well as petro
leum mining activity Kesiena and Didigwu 
2012 Even more a discharge of industrial and 
individual household untreated wastes and 
soil erosions as sources of this form pollution 
Relative to the above discourse flooding has 
been identified as another major source of envi
ronmental pollution in Nigeria Kesiena and 
Didigwu 2012 The United Nations Develop
ment Programme UNDP announced that the 
Lagos flooding arose from rivers and streams 
overflowing their banks Kesiena and Didigwu 
2012  
Furthermore activities such as bush burning 
that results in deforestation has been highlighted 
as a source of soil pollution Ityavyar and 
Thomas 2012 A notable scholar has posited 
that when ground is broken for farming or com
mercial purposes vegetation is removed expos
ing the soil layer to unnecessary contractions 
from construction equipment Peters 2015 
Runoff and storm flow increase while land ero
sion is enhanced thus increasing sedimentary 
loads down the alley Peters 2015 This effect 
obstructs smooth flow thus increasing flooding 
and shift in configuration of the channel bottom 
Peters 2015 It equally alters species of fish 
due to the changes produced in the flora and 
fauna upon which the fishes depend Peters 
2015  
However none of these pollution sources seem 
to have equaled the extent of environmental 
damage that has been caused by Nigeria’s oil and 
gas sector Orubu et al 2004 Indeed scholars 
of environmental law trace a bane of Nigeria’s oil 
pollution to the 1956 discovery of oil in Oloibiri 
Bayelsa state Mmadu 2013 They assert that 
the environmental pollution and degradation 
that has emanated from oil spill in Nigeria has led 
to the destruction of landscape loss of arable 
farmlands aesthetic environment fishing opera
tions revenue and sometime lives Kadafa 
2012 Instances of death resulting from oil pol
lution in Nigeria’s Niger Delta include the re
ported death of over 100 persons in the Jesse in
ferno as well as the numerous deaths from the 
Idaho crude oil platform spill which tragically af
fected five communities Peters 2015  
A reason for the huge effects the oil and gas in
dustry has had on the Nigerian environment and 
public health as against other common sources 
of pollution identified above might not be un
connected to the fact that the oil and gas sector 
is a sizable portion of the Nigerian economy 
Akinlo 2012 Uwakonye et al 2006 Scholars 
believe crude oil production has become more 
relevant in contemporary times as there is yet no 
cheaper alternative to it as a form of energy Oy
ende 2012 Indeed over 80 of Nigeria’s reve
nue comes from sale of oil produced from the Ni
ger Delta region which is home to Nigeria’s oil 
production Ite et al 2013 Oduyemi and Ogun
tseitan 1985 Takon 2014 Therefore it seems 
to be a necessary evil that the Nigerian country 
cannot escape from It is therefore trite to as
sume that while there seems to be a perceived 
usefulness of oil and gas in the Nigerian society 
the volatility of the industry necessitates some 
regulation that would check the extent of degra
dation caused on the environment by it 
To address environmental issues in their oil sec
tor various other jurisdictions such as the 
United States Federal jurisdiction Norway or 
even Alberta of Canada have enacted legislation 
regulating their oil sector while setting up en
forcement institutions to implement provisions 
of the appropriate legislation Hayman and 
Brack 2002 Nigeria has been no exception to 
this Prior to June 1988 Nigeria’s response to en
vironment matters seemed to be on an ad hoc ba
sis Ikhariale 1989 Environmental legislations 
at the time seemed to rather be in response to 
selective challenges oil discovery and industrial
ization brought as they came individually rather 
than a holistic approach at examining these envi
ronmental misconduct as collective crimes Ola

Although the Criminal Code provided some light 
sanctions against minor environmental infringe
ments Criminal Code Act 2004 the statute 
failed to make any strong preventive sanctions 
against the spate of increasing major criminal 
pollution such as that caused by harmful waste 
discharge This deficiency became evident from 
the Koko incident Liu 1992 Ogbodo 2009 
This incident in 1988 was as a result of some ship 
loads of toxic nuclear waste materials which 
were allegedly imported from Italy by a contrac
tor dumped on a farm in Koko town near the Sa
pele River in the former Bendel State of Nigeria 
now Delta State 
In reaction to the shock of the incident the Nige
rian government organized an international 
workshop on the environment Aina and Aded
ipe 1991 a conference that resulted in the for
mulation of a National Policy on Environment 
NPE in 1991 and later revised in 1999 This 
policy framework became a formula for enacting 
environmental laws in Nigeria especially for en
vironmental regulation within the oil and gas 
sector Oyende 2012  
Paragraph 8 of the 1991 NPE states thus Federal 
Environmental Protection Agency 1999 
The legal framework as a component of the na
tional environmental policy should be designed as 
an instrument that recognises the need to achieve 
a balance between environment development and 
socioeconomic considerations 
Hence it recognizes the principle of sustainable 
development as a principle that must guide the 
formation of Nigeria’s environmental laws to
ward achieving environmental protection To 
ensure this it provides that action shall be taken 
to  
a periodically evaluate current legislation with a 
view to updating existing provisions  
b streamline all legislation and regulations relat
ing to the environment with a view to reor
ganising them into a holistic and integrated 
compact that recognises the crosssectoral 
linkages of the environment  
c prescribe jurisdictional boundaries for law mak
ing on the environment as well as provide clear 
responsibilities to promote coordination and 
eliminate overlapping of functions among the 
various ties of government provide for the de
velopment of appropriate law for environmen
tal emergencies 
The provisions of the NPE apparently seeks to 
provide a strong regulatory framework for the 
Nigerian environment To wit several environ
mental laws have been enacted to ensure a pro
tection of the environment under the theme of 
achieving sustainable development Oyende 
2012 The World Commission on Environment 
and Development 1987 has defined sustaina
ble development to mean a “development meets 
the needs of the present without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs”  
According to Principle 4 of the Rio Declaration 
“in order to achieve sustainable development 
environmental protection shall constitute an in
tegral part of the development process and can
not be considered in isolation from it” UN Con
vention on the Rio Declaration of Environment 
and Development 1992 Similarly Article 11 of 
the Treaty of the Functioning of the European 
Union 2012 provides that “Environmental pro
tection requirements must be integrated into the 
definition and implementation of all areas of 
policy in particular with a view to promoting 
sustainable development”  
Even more Paragraph 5 of the “Political Declara
tion” at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable 
Development enforced “economic development 
social development and environmental protec
tion” as the “interdependent and mutually rein
forcing pillars of sustainable development” 
Conference Report on World Summit on Sus
tainable Development 2002 Environmental 
protection is therefore arguably a core compo
nent of the sustainable development principle  
An important issue for this article is therefore 
not whether environmental laws regulating the 
oil production exist in Nigeria but rather how ef
fective such laws have been in achieving the de
sired sustainable development Indeed to appre
ciate the aptness of these legislative enactments 
in the oil and gas sector one must first under
stand the circumstantial incidents that have hap
pened since the years of Nigeria’s foray into oil 
and gas exploration and production

Extensive Oil Spill Pollution and its Ef
fects as it is in Nigeria 
The United Nations Development Programme 
UNDP estimates that between 1976 and 2001 
alone there were an approximate of 6800 spills 
totaling 3 million barrels of oil United Nations 
Development Programme 2006 Similarly re
ports showed that there were 253 oil spills in 
2006 588 oil spills in 2007 and 419 oil spills in 
the first 6 months of 2008 Yakubu 2008 Cu
mulatively an estimated 9 to 13 million barrels 
15 million tons of oil has spilled into the Niger 
Delta over the past 53 years Imoobe and Tanshi 
2009  
Marine waters in Nigeria and their basins in
clude all navigable rivers such as the rivers Niger 
and Benue the rivers Sokoto Ogun Hadejia Ka
duna Gongola Katsina Ala and Cross River etc 
and their tributaries National Inland Water
ways Authority Act 2004 There are also 
smaller bodies of water enclosed by the lagoons 
such as the Lagos Lagoon the creeks etc which 
are also regarded as internal waters under the 
Act Record has it that most parts of these rivers 
have been polluted by oil wastes thus destroying 
aquatic life and presence in their respective 
forms Oyende 2012  
An Amnesty International Report has observed 
that the repeated oil wastes that has caused dam
age to the water system of the Niger Delta the 
rivers streams ponds is majorly constituted of 
oil spills and waste discharges from oil compa
nies Amnesty International 2009 This report 
becomes interesting as several Niger Delta indi
genes rely on fishing for their sustenance and 
survival Amnesty International 2009 The 
damage effect has not been limited to aquatic life 
but has also affected even the natural survival of 
man A recent study of the United Nations Envi
ronmental Programme 2011 found that drink
ing water in Ogoniland a native name for the Ni
ger Delta contained a known carcinogen at lev
els 900 times above World Health Organization 
WHO guidelines United Nations Environmen
tal Programme 2011 
It is also a known fact that the people of the Niger 
Delta region rely mostly on agriculture for food 
and their livelihood Oyende 2012 Interest
ingly it has been reported that oil pipelines run 
across farmlands and other oil infrastructure 
such as well heads and flow stations which are 
often close to agricultural land Amnesty Inter
national 2009 It is therefore easy for a spill to 
destroy viable crops of Niger Delta farmers A 
study found that oil spills in the Niger Delta re
gion reduces the ascorbic content of vegetables 
by an estimate of 36 and the crude protein con
tent of cassava by an estimate of 40 thus re
sulting in a 24 increase in the prevalence of 
childhood malnutrition in the region Ordinioha 
and Brisibe 2013 Another has posited that 
emissions from the combustion of associated gas 
contains toxins such as benzene nitrogen oxides 
dioxin etc which increase air prone disease 
risk insecurity of food and damage to the 
weather Edafienene 2012  
It is further asserted that oil spills on land also 
cause the ground to become toxic and this con
stitutes a danger to plants and animals who feed 
on these materials Oyende 2012 Several of 
these spills have been linked to the exploration 
activities of oil multinationals in the Niger Delta 
region such as the Shell Petroleum Development 
Company SPDC and others Amnesty Interna
tional 2011 However reports have shown that 
despite a relinquishment of some assets for
merly belonging to some oil multinationals oper
ating in Nigeria such as the Shell subsidiary
SPDC to the Nigeria Petroleum Development 
Company NPDC oil pipeline spills in areas such 
as the Itsekiri and Ilaje coastal communities have 
yet continued Amaize 2017 
A sustained pollution in Nigeria’s oil production 
sector as discussed above makes one wonder 
whether there are existing legislations in Nigeria 
sanctioning oil spill The article shall therefore 
explore to what extent the existing legal frame
work on oil production in Nigeria has effectively 
sanctioned oil spill  
 
The Nigerian Constitution 
Firstly the Nigerian constitution 1999 is the 
grundnorm of all laws in Nigeria Section 20 of 
the Nigerian constitution provides that “the 
State shall protect and improve the environment 
and safeguard the water air and land forest and

wild life of Nigeria” Hence the Nigerian constitu
tion creates an obligation on the Nigerian gov
ernment and its enforcement organs to ensure 
environmental protection while guaranteeing 
public safety This provision in other words cre
ates some form of liability for the Nigerian gov
ernment albeit in circumstances where they fail 
to comply with the obligation Interestingly it 
includes some form of criminal liability to any Ni
gerian government that fails orand has failed 
to regulate the environmental crime in Nigeria  
Forthwith other environmental laws regulating 
the oil sector has been enacted It is interesting 
that despite the apparent disregard to the Nige
rian environment the environmental law regime 
in Nigeria is replete with legislations of this na
ture Ijaiya and Joseph 2014 Amongst such 
laws are the Petroleum Act the Oil Pipelines Act 
the Petroleum Production and Distribution Anti 
Sabotage Act and the Petroleum Industries Bill 
In this regard these legislations will be scruti
nized in order to determine their overall effec
tiveness in sanctioning oil spill in Nigeria 
 
Petroleum Act  
The Petroleum Act 1990 was enacted to regu
late all petroleum activities in Nigeria Orji 
2012 Section 23 of the Petroleum Act man
dates a lessee or licensee to pay “fair and ade
quate compensation for the disturbance of sur
face or other rights to any person who owns or is 
in lawful occupation of the licensed or leased 
land” Indeed the obligation created by the Act 
on a potential lessee or licensee to pay some 
form of compensation for surface disturbance is 
laudable However the Act fails to define or in
terpret exactly what it deems to be “fair and ad
equate” The vagueness caused by the failure of 
the Act to precisely define what it deems as “fair 
and adequate” leaves the determination to the 
court which can be belittled by a good lawyer on 
legal technicalities   
One must adequately examine what truly consti
tutes “disturbance to surface” Surface disturb
ance as it relates to the environment has been 
defined as “…exposure covering or erosion of 
the surface of land in any manner or the degra
dation or deterioration in any manner of the 
physical surface of land” Government of Al
berta 2017 It seems therefore that the Petro
leum Act merely provided some form of financial 
liability for petroleum pollution of the Nigerian 
lands thus neglecting petroleum pollution on the 
Nigerian waters and severe air pollution of gas 
flaring which constitutes a severity of the Nige
rian pollution likewise  
Furthermore there seems to be a vagueness as 
to whether a scope of pollution covered by this 
provision covers just the soil or just the plants 
and structures on the soil or both the soil and the 
plants and structures on it This uncertainty was 
highlighted in Shell Petroleum Development Com
pany of Nigeria Ltd v Councillor F B Farah 
1995 In this case an oil well blowout polluted 
about 60700 hectares of land The top soil was 
heavily contaminated but SPDC abandoned the 
rehabilitation of the land and offered only N44 
00000 125 as compensation The respond
ents who had 13 245 hectares of the affected 
land were paid only N2000 550 for their 
crops and economic trees but no compensation 
was paid for the contaminated soil Although the 
Act 
eventually 
awarded 
damages 
of 
N462130700 12800 the court had to rely 
on common law principles of assessment of dam
ages for tort as the Petroleum Act provided no 
guidance for the court to rely on 
Interestingly the succeeding regulation borne 
out of its inadequacy has made no practical im
provements to its deficiencies Phrases such as 
“practicable precaution” “uptodate equip
ment” “prompt step” “good oil field practices” 
and “good refining practices” run through the Pe
troleum Drilling and Production Regulation 
2004 with no particular clarification as to what 
they actually entail within the Regulation Hence 
the Regulation provides no practical interpreta
tion of these phrases that constitute the core 
subjects of its enactment 
 
Oil Pipelines Act 
The Oil Pipelines Act 1956 was enacted to reg
ulate the granting of licenses for the establish
ment and maintenance of oil pipelines this is 
provided for in the Preamble to the Act This Act 
gives the holder of an oil pipeline license right to 
International Journal of Environment and Sustainability 2018 71 3044 
35 
 
 Science Target Inc wwwsciencetargetcom 
enter upon take possession of or use a strip of 
land specified in the license and construct main
tain and operate an oil pipeline and ancillary in
stallation Section 111 of Act However the 
Act also requires such holder to prevent poten
tial pollution arising from such spill through its 
provision for compensation under section 115 
of the Act Section 115 of the Act provides thus 
The holder of a licence shall pay compensation – 
a to any person whose land or interest in land 
whether or not it is land respect of which the 
licence has been granted is injuriously af
fected by the exercise of the rights conferred by 
the licence for any such injurious affection not 
otherwise made good and 
b to any person suffering damage by reason of any 
neglect on the part of the holder or his agents 
servants or workmen to protect maintain or 
repair any work structure or thing executed 
under the licence for any such damage not oth
erwise made good and 
c to any person suffering damage other than on 
account of his own default or on account of the 
malicious act of a third person as a conse
quence of any breakage of or leakage from the 
pipeline or an ancillary installation for any 
such damage not otherwise made good 
By this provision a license holder under this Act 
is obligated to pay compensation to a person 
whose land or interest has been affected by the 
exercise of the right under the license A careful 
examination of section 115c shows some 
form of defense to the license holder in the sense 
that such license holder could easily allege a 
damage of the oil pipeline that had caused a spill 
was due to the acts of a third party Hence a mere 
allusion as to the cause of an oil spill to be the 
willful sabotage of oil pipelines by local indi
genes of the Niger Delta could absolve oil opera
tors of the liability of compensating victims of 
the Niger Delta oil spills The Act could there
fore encourage an arbitrary abuse of the strict li
ability rule by corporate oil polluters seeking to 
evade the sanction imposed by the provisions of 
the Act The Act could therefore defeat the very 
purpose for its enactment  
 
Petroleum Production and Distribution 
Anti Sabotage Act 
It is on record that several oil companies in Nige
ria have alleged several pollutions from their fa
cilities to pipeline sabotage and vandalism 
Frynas 2002 Whilst this article has tried to al
lude to a use of sabotage by local indigenes as a 
defense to oil spill liability on the part of such op
erators the article yet agrees with the opinion of 
other scholars that there might be events of sab
otage of oil pipelines by local indigenes in the Ni
ger Delta Augustine 2005 British Broadcasting 
Corporation 2010 Hinshaw and Kent 2016  
As had been asserted by a scholar that “Crude oil 
is tapped from pipelines and terminals of the oil 
producing companies with advanced technologi
cal equipment in the waterways creeks swamps 
and high seas Plastic pipes are fixed to manifold 
points and intersection of several pipelines and 
crude oil is then pumped into barges In some 
cases ships are hooked to hoses that siphon 
crude from MNC facilities that may be several 
hundred meters away” Ikelegbe 2005 Shell 
Producing Development Company SPDC of Ni
geria have repeatedly alleged illegal refining and 
thirdparty interference as a main source of pol
lution in the Niger Delta Shell Nigeria 2017 
The Petroleum Production and Distribution Anti 
Sabotage Act 1975 defines sabotage as a per
son who  
a wilfully does anything with intent to obstruct or 
prevent the production or distribution of petro
leum products in any part of Nigeria or  
b wilfully does anything with intent to obstruct or 
prevent the procurement of petroleum prod
ucts for distribution in any part of Nigeria or 
c wilfully does anything in respect of any vehicle 
or any public highway with intent to obstruct 
or prevent the use of that vehicle or that public 
highway for the distribution of petroleum 
product 
The Act stipulates the death penalty or an im
prisonment term of 21 years as punishment for 
an offender under the Act This punishment 
seems more than sufficient to sanction an envi
ronmental crime of its sort However there is yet 
any known official case against oil sabotage in

the country This makes it seems as if the Act is a 
toothless dog with no real sense of enforcement 
 
Petroleum Industries Bill 
The Petroleum Industry Bill 2012 seeks to 
“provide for the establishment of a legal fiscal 
and regulatory framework for the Petroleum In
dustry in Nigeria and for other related matters” 
Preamble to the Bill This implies that the Bill 
covers all matters relative to oil and gas in Nige
ria including environmental matters that relate 
to both spheres Subject to Section 61 “The 
Federal Government shall to the extent practica
ble honor international environmental obliga
tions and shall promote energy efficiency the 
provision of reliable energy and a taxation pol
icy that encourages fuel efficiency by producers 
and consumers”  
The clause “…to the extent practicable” Section 
61 above of the Bill reiterates the position of 
the NESREA Act as it regards international envi
ronmental treaties and obligations on oil and gas 
matters only shifting from the position of em
powerment of NESREA on such international ob
ligations to a mandate of the federal government 
However by employing the caveat “…to the ex
tent practicable” the provision suddenly reduces 
the certainty on the extent to which the federal 
government can honor such international trea
ties This is because such caveat creates some 
form of escape to the federal government from 
committing to the international environmental 
obligations  
Section 283 of the Bill provides that 
Every licensee or lessee engaged in petroleum op
erations shall within three months of the com
mencement of this Act submit an environmental 
programme or an environmental quality manage
ment plan…which shall 
a Contain the licensees written 
b Commitment to comply with relevant laws reg
ulations guidelines and standards 
c Investigate assess and evaluate the impact of 
the licensee or lessees proposed exploration 
and production activities on  
i the environment and  
ii the socioeconomic conditions of any per
son who might be directly affected by the 
petroleum operations 
d develop an environmental awareness plan de
scribing the manner in which the applicant in
tends to inform his or her employees of any en
vironmental risks which may result from their 
work and the manner in which the risks must 
be dealt with in order to avoid pollution or the 
degradation of the environment proposed ex
ploration and production activities on…the en
vironment 
e Describe the way he or she intends to i modify 
remedy control or stop any action activity or 
process which causes pollution or environmen
tal degradation ii contain or remedy the 
cause of pollution or degradation and migra
tion of pollutants and iii comply with any 
prescribed waste standard or management 
standards or practices 
Similarly 2851 of the Bill provides thus  
Prior to the approval of the environmental man
agement plan or environmental management pro
gramme by the Minister every licensee or lessee 
shall pay the prescribed financial provision to the 
Inspectorate in accordance with guidelines as may 
be issued by the Inspectorate from time to time for 
the rehabilitation or management of negative en
vironmental impacts as a condition for the grant 
of the said licence or lease 
Indeed the provisions of Section 283 of the Bill 
cover a tender of EIA in the form of quality man
agement plans However this Bill fails to provide 
any penalty whatsoever against a potential of
fender who fails to tender this plan This implies 
that if in essence the Bill is passed into law there 
would be no real criminal penalty sanctioning 
environmental matters in the oil and gas sector 
in Nigeria  
Similarly in providing that the licensee shall 
make some payments from the onset toward the 
remediation or management of environmental 
damage Section 285 1 of the Bill seems to an
ticipate environmental harm even before the ac
tual commission which considering the fact that 
the Bill makes no actual provision for the partic
ular amount that  shall be set aside for this pur
pose but leaves it to the inspectorate nor does 
International Journal of Environment and Sustainability 2018 71 3044

 Science Target Inc wwwsciencetargetcom 
the bill provide any form of penalty for a criminal 
breach of the licensee to tender an environmen
tal quality management plan EQMP might nat
urally make a licensee chose to pay the pre
scribed financial provision set aside refuse to 
tender any form of EQMP and yet commit pollu
tion crimes 
Furthermore Section 2931 of the bill provides 
that 
any person engaged in activities requiring a li
cence lease or permit in the upstream and down
stream sectors of the petroleum industry shall 
manage all environmental impacts in accordance 
with the licensee or lessee’s approved environmen
tal management plan or programme It shall be 
the responsibility of every licensee or lessee as far 
as reasonably practicable to rehabilitate the envi
ronment affected by exploration and production 
activities whenever environmental impacts occur 
as a result of the licensee or lessee’s operations 
However Section 2932 of the Bill exempts the 
licensee or lessee from liabilities for the rehabil
itation of the environment where the act ad
versely affecting the environment has occurred 
because of sabotage of petroleum facilities which 
includes tampering with the integrity of any pe
troleum pipeline and storage systems It went 
further to provide that any dispute as to the 
cause of an act that has adversely affected the en
vironment shall be referred to the Downstream 
Regulatory Agency which it refers to as the 
Agency by the licensee lessee or any affected 
person for determination and that such determi
nation by the Agency shall be final Even more 
Section 2934 of the Bill expressly provides 
that 
Where the determination is that the act adversely 
affecting the environment has occurred as a result 
of sabotage the costs of restoration and remedia
tion shall be borne by the local government coun
cil and the state governments within which the act 
of sabotage occurred 
 An attribution of vicarious liability to states and 
local government councils within which any act 
of sabotage adversely affecting the environment 
has occurred is grossly unjustifiable Firstly this 
is because a determination by the Agency of any 
such dispute under Section 2932 of the Bill 
seems to be a derogation of an exercise of pow
ers that should be clearly judicial in nature It is 
therefore doubtful whether the Agency which 
is not a court or tribunal established by law and 
vested with judicial power is competent to 
make such determination in any dispute arising 
between a licenseelessee on the one hand and a 
local government council or state on the other   
It is an undisputable principle of constitutional 
law that such judicial powers of adjudication can 
only be exercised by competent judicial courts or 
tribunals established under law with legal pow
ers and capacity to adjudicate rather than an 
Agency as the PIB Bill proposes This point has 
been wellenunciated by Nwabueze who defined 
the concept of independence of the judiciary as 
implying Nwabueze 1992 
First that the powers exercised by the courts in the 
adjudication of disputes is independent of legisla
tive and executive powers so as to make it usurpa
tion to attempt to exercise it either directly by leg
islation as by a Bill of Attainder or by vesting any 
part of it in a body which is not a court secondly 
that the personnel of the court are independent of 
the legislature and the executive as regards their 
appointment removal and other conditions of ser
vice 
Similarly in Kayili v Yilbuk 2015 the Supreme 
Court held that 
Section 32 of the Chiefs Appointment and Dep
osition Law of Northern Nigeria 1963 which pro
vided that in the case of any dispute the Governor 
after due inquiry and consultation with the per
sons concerned in the selection shall be the sole 
judge as to whether any appointment of a Chief 
has been made in accordance with native law and 
custom was null and void because the provision 
purported to oust the unlimited jurisdiction of the 
State High Court and conferred same on the Gov
ernor 
Secondly relying on the ruling on the 
SPDCBodo case The Tides Newspaper 2014 
it can be presumed that the licensee or lessee has 
a general shielding and caring obligation toward 
the host community to protect it against avoida
ble harm arising from its operations An estab
lished common law rule is that

The one who carries out hazardous activity on 
land is responsible for failing to anticipate and 
minimise the damaging effect of all trespassers 
even those who are illintentioned If a facility is 
not adequately secured against such trespassers 
then the owner or operator of that facility can be 
at least partly responsible for the damage done to 
third parties by for example thieves or others who 
have malicious intent Leader et al 2014   
Interestingly the provisions of Section 2934 of 
the Bill do not only seem to go against this case 
law but also seems to contradict the provisions 
under Section 41 of the extant Environmental 
Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum In
dustry in Nigeria which states that an operator 
shall be responsible for the containment and re
covery of any spill discovered within its opera
tional area whether or not its source is known 
The operator shall take prompt and adequate 
steps to contain remove and dispose of the spill” 
Department of Petroleum Resources 1992 
It is notable that even in tort “the party that has 
the greatest control over the risks and can re
duce them most effectively should be assigned li
ability” Tuytel and Dyke 2011 This is because 
“imposing liability on parties who are in the best 
position to mitigate risks provides incentives to 
do so” Tuytel and Dyke 2011 Hence consider
ing the fact that one of such prominent operators 
in Nigeria such as Shell who ranks top ten on the 
Fortune 500 Fortune 2017 it is only a reason
able expectation that in a case of satisfaction of 
liability between them and the host community 
the former would rather be in the best position 
to mitigate the risks of sabotage Thus a defense 
of sabotage does not provide an automatic shield 
to them as the operator or owner of the facility 
unless it is established that all reasonable dili
gence has been exercised to secure and super
vise the facility against interference by third par
ties  
Interestingly relying on the rationale for a vicar
ious liability relationship to exist being that 
there has to be a special relationship between 
the parties there seems to be no grounds set out 
under the Bill on identifying the special relation
ship between any oilproducing host state local 
government council and the perceived third
party saboteurs within the boundaries of the 
said states and local government councils 
Hence there seems to be no justifiable grounds 
to impose a vicarious liability on the third party  
Indeed until identified that any such relation
ship exists between oilproducing host states 
local government councils and vandals of petro
leum facilities and installations and a clear 
ground of such identification is shown it would 
rather be unjustifiable to place any liability on 
oilproducing host stateslocal government 
councils Thus in Gilbert Okoroma  Ors v Nige
rian Agip Oil Co Ltd 1976 Manuel J dismiss
ing the defense of sabotage raised by the defend
ant held that “the act of a third party is a good 
defence    but evidence must be led either to 
identify such third party or show circumstances 
to lead to an irresistible conclusion of the act of 
third party whose act was neither unforeseeable 
nor controllable by the defendant”  
Even more Section 116 of the Bill proposes the 
establishment of the Petroleum Host Communi
ties Fund PHC Fund toward developing the 
economic and social infrastructure of the com
munities within the petroleum producing area in 
accordance with Section 117 thereof To give ef
fect to Section 117 Section 1181 of the Bill pro
vides that upstream petroleum producing com
pany shall remit on a monthly basis ten per cent 
of its net profit into the PHC Fund Section 1181 
a and b of the Bill provides the beneficiaries 
of the PHC Fund to be the host communities 
within the petroleum producing areas and the 
petroleum producing littoral states  
 Curiously Section 118 5 of the Bill creates a 
loophole which can be exploited as a dangerous 
escape which can result to a depletion of the 
Fund to the detriment of host communities by 
providing that in the event of vandalism sabo
tage or other civil unrest occurs that causes 
damage to any petroleum facilities within a host 
community the cost of repair of such facilities 
shall be paid from the Fund unless it is estab
lished that no member of the community was re
sponsible for the damage The danger the be
comes thus giving the persistent allegations of 
vandalism and sabotage of petroleum facilities 
by oil companies against host communities and 
the very fact that this has been found to be mere

 Science Target Inc wwwsciencetargetcom 
allegation to escape liability it might be unsur
prising that virtually any damage to petroleum 
facilities within host communities could be at
tributed to the host communities with the result 
that cost of repairs of damaged petroleum facili
ties would simply become a drain on the Fund  
 By stating “…the cost of repair of such facility 
shall be paid from the PHC Fund entitlement un
less it is established that no member of the com
munity is responsible” Section 1185 of the bill 
seems to place the burden of proving that no 
member of the host community was involved or 
responsible for the act of vandalism or sabotage 
that caused damage to petroleum facilities 
within the host community on the host commu
nity It therefore might not be so wrong to pre
sume the placement of the burden of proof of in
nocence on the host community might defeat the 
purpose of the PHC Fund as failure by the host 
community to discharge the burden of proof in 
any given case implies that the PHC Fund that 
has accrued in favor of the host community will 
be applied to offset the cost of repairs to the 
damaged facilities and installations In this way 
the Petroleum Host Communities’ Fund could be 
drained for purposes other than that for which it 
is primarily proposed  
It is notable that besides the fact that this bill 
provides no seeming strict criminal penalty 
sanctioning oil pollution and provides no cer
tainty as to the legal obligation imposed on the 
Federal government to abide by international 
treaties for the protection of the environment it 
also seems to be in favor of oil operators as it 
provides clear escape route from some liabilities 
that might have deterred the extent of criminal 
pollution they cause in the Niger Delta It is 
therefore almost clear that although the oil and 
gas sector presents the worst spate of criminal 
pollution in the country the PIB which ordinar
ily should have become a standard of environ
mental protection and punishment of criminal 
pollution within the country provides no real so
lution in the sense  
It is provided under the Preamble of Bill that it 
seeks to address environmental concern in the 
petroleum and possibly gas sector Zacchaeus 
2016 Upon passage the bill shall repeal all ex
isting legislation governing oil and gas in Nigeria 
Section 354 of Bill Interestingly scholars have 
pointed out that the Bill does little or nothing in 
depleting the actual structure and content of the 
existing environmental laws in the oil and gas 
sector but rather offer mere repetitions of the ex
isting respective legislations it was made to re
peal Musa and Bappah 2014 These scholars 
have even asserted that the Bill rather seems to 
offer less solutions in terms of securing environ
mental protection than the respective legisla
tions its parts have been made to repeal  
An example where the bill has merely reflected 
the structure of an existing environmental Act 
without necessarily making any addition being 
the very essence for its drafting is that the Bill 
in line with the Petroleum Act 1969 stipulates 
under Section 1982 that “a licensee or lessee 
who causes damage or injury to a tree or object 
of commercial value or which is the object of ven
eration shall pay fair and adequate compensa
tion to the persons or communities directly af
fected by the damage or injury” This provision is 
laudable in the sense that it guarantees some 
form of compensation from the offender who 
disturbs the surface However just like its prede
cessor the Bill fails to explicitly define or inter
pret what it deems to be “fair and adequate” Fur
thermore it fails to explicitly interpret what 
should be deemed as “any other right” 
Indeed a comparison of the above provision of 
Section 1982 of the Bill and Section 23 of the 
Petroleum Act shows a clear repetition of struc
ture and intent together with the apparent limi
tations reflective in both cases This makes one 
wonder if the Bill has really made any clear addi
tion to what already exists or merely repeated 
what is already existing and obsolete  
Similarly Section 200 of the Bill provides that 
“every licensee or lessee engaged in upstream 
petroleum operations shall within one year of 
the commencement of this Act or within 3 
months after having been granted the license or 
lease submit an environmental management 
plan to the inspectorate for approval” While this 
provision is laudable the Bill provides no mech
anism of inspecting the said plan that has been 
submitted to ensure that it is accurate nor does 
the Bill provide any mechanism for affected com

munities to request an inspection of sites or ar
eas they deem to be polluted or at risk from pol
lution Thus the Bill fails to encourage public 
participation in this regard  
On May 25 2017 the Nigerian Senate passed the 
first tranche of the Petroleum Industry Bill PIB 
titled the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill 
2016 at the Senate House although this is yet 
to be passed at the House of Representative the 
Nigerian National legislative arm is made up of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives and 
Bills must go through both Houses to effectively 
become an Act Vanguard 2017 This Bill is only 
a part of the PIB and contains just very few parts 
of the PIB Interestingly the PIGB does not make 
any additions to the PIB but rather only repeals 
or retains some of its sections Virtually every 
section of the PIB that relates to environmental 
issues have been retained This is except for the 
provision of PHCF that was reflected in the PIB 
and was repealed in the PIGB It is therefore not 
surprising that the PIGB has provided no extra 
details to environmental matters besides what 
existed in the mother document PIB  
 
Conclusion 
A cursory look through the discussions above 
shows an ineffectiveness of environmental regu
lations in extant petroleum laws in Nigeria In
deed the current structure of the PIB and its 
componential parts still fail to provide any nec
essary solution to either of these weaknesses It 
is the view of this article that extant petroleum 
laws in Nigerian laws has failed to reflect current 
pollution incidents in Nigeria’s petroleum sector 
This is either because the provisions of laws have 
become outdated and not measurable to the per
vasive nature of recent oil pollutions in Nigeria 
or the wordings of the provisions are too vague 
to convey an adequate interpretation of the pur
pose of the statutes Interestingly the PIB which 
should be a respite to the ailing petroleum sec
tor and which under normal circumstances 
should create a more effective regulatory capac
ity for environmental protection in Nigeria’s oil 
sector seems unable to do so 
It is therefore a position of this article that most 
petroleum laws in Nigeria be revised to amend 
the regulatory component of such laws espe
cially with regards to the environment Further
more a revision of such laws becomes apt to 
bring the sanctioning under the laws at par with 
the current spate of pollution activities in Nige
ria’s oil sector Above all the PIB should be 
amended before its final passage as law as its 
current state reflects no real improvement to the 
laws it had been made to repeal
