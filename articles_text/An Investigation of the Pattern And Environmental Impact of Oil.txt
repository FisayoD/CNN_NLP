ABSTRACT
Oil spillage in Niger Delta region of Nigeria has been on an increase and almost on a regular basis The objective of this study is on the causes and 
terrain of oil spillage in the Niger Delta with emphasis on which causes have significant effect on the volume of oil spillage the terrain that is most 
affected The two way analysis of variance statistical tool was employed and it was discovered that the “sabotage” cause was significant at a 5 
level of significance and from the pairwise multiple comparison the “sabotage” cause was seen as the major causes of oil spillage in the Niger Delta 
followed by the “operational” and “mystery spill” causes respectively It was also discovered that the incident site that was most affected was the 
swamp terrain with 82 while water was 46 and land with 65 The study concluded that to reduce or manage oil spillage in Nigeria the Federal 
government and Federal environmental management agency should enforce the laws governing oil spill incident in Nigeria

1 INTRODUCTION
Oil was first discovered on commercial basis in the Niger Delta 
region of Nigeria at Oloibiri the present day Bayelsa state in the 
year 1956 more discoveries were made after that of Olobiri and 
exports began in the year 1958 almost 2 years after discovery at 
Olobiri Although the quantities only became significant in the 
year 1965 and this was because the terminal at Bonny Island 
in Rivers State and the necessary pipelines to feed the terminal 
were completed The Nigerian export was put at an average of 
25 million barrels each day in the year 2004 and its reserve at 
35 billion barrels CAB 2005
Niger Delta is an area with strong cultural diversity The Niger 
delta occupies a total land mass of 75 it has 9 states and 186 
local government areas housing at least 25 million people The 
Niger Delta to the southern part of Nigeria is 70000 km2 through 
which the two rivers Niger and Benue these rivers bare into 
the Atlantic Ocean all it possesses There are other main rivers 
rivers like Benin Brass Bonny Cross Kwaibo Forcados Nun 
and other streams and creeks or brooks which are linked and 
interwoven by a network of creeks NDES 1997
The Niger Delta according to Nwilo and Badejo 2005 is an area in 
which the main river that is River Niger reaches the base level and 
further branches into different tributaries releasing distributing 
and thus disposing of the water discharge and the water sediment 
load The Niger Delta has the shape of the Nile Delta Sexton and 
Murday 1994 The Delta according to Nwilo and Badejo 2005 
is regarded in the world as one of the largest wetlands
Man’s environment can be called also his immediate family this 
is because just as his immediate family are close to him so also 
his environment Man’s environment has also experienced some

levels of attack from activities of man himself These activities 
in one way or the other have impacted negatively on man hence 
results from these activities are majorly pollutions of all manner 
of degree Pollution can be said to be an introduction or discharge 
of substance into the environment that is very poisonous and thus 
harmful Thus terrain such as land water air can also be polluted 
likewise one can have noise pollution amongst others It can be said 
in a jiffy that the release of toxins in the atmosphere contaminates 
or pollutes the air poisonous substance also introduced in the 
hydrosphere contaminates water and finally poisonous substance 
in the lithosphere pollutes or contaminates the land Thus land 
water and air are basically the three major types of pollution 
the interesting part of this story is that these three components 
once affected will definitely affect the fourth which is called the 
biosphere that is an artificial enclosure that is an ecosystem 
thus life can exist there Oil spillage is a form of pollution it is a 
process whereby liquid petroleum hydrocarbon is been discharged 
or one can say released into the environment Oil spillage though 
a form of pollution is not good for the environment
Oil spill a common outcome of oil exploration and exploitation 
in the Niger delta region has an estimated spillage incident of over 
7000 over a 50year period UNDP 2006
Oil spillage occurs usually from activities of humans in their 
environment and witnessed especially in the marine ecosystem 
but oil spillages can also happen on land Whatever the terrain is 
whether land water or swamp its effect is not encouraging its 
health threatening it is harmful and should be avoided
In Nigeria there are serious environmental issues ranging from 
drought to flood to oil spillages to illegal refining and so on but it 
is interesting to note that the major environmental issues hinging 
around the Niger Delta are from the petroleum industry Oil 
theft operations illegal refining mystery spills and sabotage are 
amongst major causes of oil spills in our environment Whatever 
the cause may be be it sabotage or mystery spills or whatever 
there must be a joint investigation followed by the cleanup and 
remediation processes which is done by the shell petroleum 
development company of Nigeria limited joint venture SPDC JV
The thrust of this paper is on the causes and terrain of oil spillage 
in the Niger Delta with emphasis on which causes have significant 
effect on the volume of oil spillage the terrain that is most affected 
The two way analysis of variance would be employed to capture 
the objectives of the work
11 Causes of Oil Spillage in Nigeria
Oil spillage in Nigeria can be of a natural cause or of a human 
cause Although a third cause can be said to be the Mysterious 
cause The natural spill causes are those spills that come naturally 
that is they occur naturally examples are those that happen due 
to natural disasters shift of tectonic plates these plates are seen 
beneath the ocean floor once there is a shift oil is thus released 
thereby causing a natural seepage and spillage occurs There are 
also cases of inadequate trap system
Human causes are manmade causes usually done by humans 
Examples include vandalization of oil pipe which could bring 
about spillage carelessness on the side of both workers this 
cause is what is referred to as operational carelessness on the 
side of the tanker drivers accidents can happen during delivery 
or production operations which can cause spillage carelessness 
that could also lead to oil bunkering sabotage and oil siphoning
Mysterious causes are those causes that aren’t known that is one 
cannot pin down the exact cause of the spillage Wang et al 2001 
reported a case of mystery spill which was from Quebec in the year 
1999 seen at the river banks of St Laurence river directly in front 
of Thermex Company Investigation as regards where the spill was 
from was carried on but the interesting part of the investigation 
was that their earlier on suspicion that the spill was from a nearby 
factory though was true but the chemical composition wasn’t the 
same The mystery spill had less amount of diesel relatively to the 
oil found in the factory and elsewhere The one from the mystery 
spill was fresh to compare with Wang et al 2001
In Nigeria there are also causes of mystery spill which according 
to shell data on the second of July 2017 the estimated volume 
of oil in barrels bbl was put at 01 sixteenth of august 2016 
the estimated volume was 5 bbl On sixth of November 2015 
05 bbl on twenty ninth of September 2015 the estimated spill 
volume was 30 bbl and so on
12 Oil Spill Incidents
In Nigeria there are numbers of oil spill incidents which have 
occurred in different part of the country at different or same time 
period Over the years Nigeria had experienced a lot of oil spill 
incident but the most striking one is that of January 17th 1980 
which was publicised as having an estimated spill volume of 
370 million litres which was caused by a blow out at Funiwa 5 
offshore station Nwilo and Badejo 2005 Table 1 shows some 
prominent oil spill incident in nigeria the date of the spillage the 
terrain the site the estimated spill volume and the causes of the 
oil spill Although from the table below one would discover that 
some of the estimated spill volume are much bigger than what 
was seen in the eighties
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
Smith et al 1982 developed oil spill risk analysis model to help in 
estimating the hazards caused by oil spill in the environment The 
model though computerized was used in analysing the probability 
of spill occurrences and also the paths where the spill occurred 
They used sample of 500 spills per season and the resulting 
model output included conditional impact probability tables and 
probability for oil spill occurrences Their model is still in use in 
the United States under the oil spill risk assessments Smith et al 
1982 Another research on oil spill was that carried out by Olujobi 
et al 2018 they adopted a development strategy that was also 
sustainable it was sustainable in the sense that it could maintain 
prudent management of oil resources Olujobi et al 2018 also 
applied an enduring model that could aid in natural environment 
conservation The aforementioned terms according to them

prudent management sustainable development strategies and 
environment conservation were imperative and necessities for the 
Nigerian economy Olujobi et al 2018 employed the descriptive 
legal analysis and secondary data sources and concluded that the 
oil spills in Nigeria should be addressed and that positive attitude 
should be put in place by the oil operators and the government 
alike so as to reduce the health hazard caused by these spillage 
Olujobi et al 2018
Another group of researchers employed a multiresolution analysis 
of polarimetric SAR data by the use of wavelet frames in observing 
the sea oil spill Gambardella et al 2008 Gambardella et al 
2008 obtained a vector of covariance matrix elements from the 
set of polarimetric data and the corresponding variances were also 
obtained They concluded that wind speed can affect sensitivity to 
polar dependency and that their analysis can aid in oil description 
Gambardella et al 2008
Wegeberg et al 2017 described techniques for combating main 
oil spills The chemical dispersants the mechanical recovery and 
in situ burning and also looked at their possible application in the 
Arctic the Arctic according to them were described as part I and in 
their part II the description of the techniques used in ascertaining 
the environmental effects was investigated and in Part III they 
monitored the effect of the spills and its responses and so on 
They concluded by saying that wildlife shouldn’t be exposed 
to these oil spillage likewise humans Wegeberg et al 2017 
Bayesian supervised and unsupervised segmentation algorithm 
and markov random field were applied by BioucasDias and 
Pelizzari 2010 although they first applied the Markov random 
field prior to the Bayesian on the oceanic segmentation of SAR 
images BioucasDias and Pelizzari 2010 later considered the 
least squares fit methods and it was discovered that with the 
Bayesian surpervised algorithm higher accuracies of the observed 
algorithm was achieved while the unsupervised algorithm was 
seen as an improvement to algorithm 1 and II Consequently three 
researchers applied 3 salinity values and 3 different oil that is 
light refined oil light crude oil and medium crude oil since the 
effectiveness of dispersant application on oil slick would give 
rise to factors such as salinity temperature and wavemixing 
Chandrasekar et al 2006 Chandrasekar et al 2006 used a 
full factorial experiment and discovered that the impact of salinity 
was significant only at different weather for light crude oil with 
dispersant Subsequently still on oil spill but with emphasis on 
oil classification Vogt and Sjoegren 1989 investigated both 
statistical methods and chemical compositions ie fluorescence 
spectrometry infrared spectrometry liquid chromatography with 
flame ionization GCFID for oil spill classification They further 
employed 5 procedures for 23 oil groups from 4 geographic regions 
considering their discriminating power thus applying ANOVA 
and some other statistical test and concluded that the fluorescence 
spectrometry sulphur nickel and vanadium contents are useful 
for oil classifications Vogt and Sjoegren 1989 Ndeh et al 
2017 identified oil spillage in Upenekang village in Ibeno local 
government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria They used water 
samples from spill site they also looked at the effects of these 
spillage and also investigated the oil spillage site Their concerns 
were on the chemical content water conductivity pH temperature 
etc they concluded that the pH of all the samples used for the 
underground and surface stream displayed that the spill site was 
acidic and the ANOVA results showed that there is insignificant 
influence of distance away from spill Ndeh et al 2017 Other 
researches done were on impact of crude oil researchers such 
as Almawali et al 2016 Moreira et al 2004 Ohanmu et al 
2018 but the works of Gingerich 2018 was totally different 
from all others since her focus was on how to maintain and store 
clean renewable energies irrespective of the climate change like 
drought flood to mention but a few She also looked at how less 
developed countries could become major global exporters of these 
renewable energies Gingerich 2018
Ohanmu et al 2018 aimed at ascertaining the changes in the 
physicochemical properties and heavy metals level of crude oil 
polluted soil using the randomized block design it was discovered 
that crude oil affects soil properties irrespective of seasons 
Ohanmu et al 2018 Moreira et al 2004 evaluated both the 
spatial and temporal impact of oil spill on the shore different 
laboratory test on toxicity were performed and it was concluded 
that the biomarkers were sensitive to exposures with respect to 
these kind of pollutions Almawali et al 2016 constructed a 
simple macroeconomic model that modelled the impact of oil 
sector on the Sultanate of Oman’s economy They discovered 
that the oil sector displayed large and strong positive impact on 
the Oman’s GDP and the impact was also felt on all other nonoil 
sectors of the economy According to them the major influence 
of oil was on the gas sector and finally they disclosed that the 
Oman’s economy cannot be diversified

per cell The data for this study is from a secondary source it is 
sourced from shell Nigeria oil spill incident ranging from January 
2015 to September 2018 The data included date of the oil spill 
incident oil spill site estimated oil spill volume bbl the joint 
investigation findings and dates of remediation and finally pictures 
of affected areas
The two way ANOVA model is given as
 
 
Xijk = μ+αi+βj+αβij+εijk 
1
Where i measures the observation per row
j measures the observation per column and k measures how many 
observations per cell
Xijk means the observation jth level of factor A and ith level of 
factor B
μ is the universal constant or observations when the factors are 
absent or treatments not applied
αi is the average effect of ith level of factor A
βj is the average effect of jth level of factor B
αβij is the interaction effect of ith level of factor A and jth level 
of factor B
εijk is the error term associated with the observation Xijk
Thus from our study the factors A and B are Causes and Terrain 
respectively while the kth observation measures the number 
of times of oil spillage estimated oil spill volume associated 
with the jth terrain and the ith causes Here ith causes runs 
from one to four where respectively they are sabotage as 1 
operational as 2 mystery spill as three and others ie other 
causes as 4 The jth terrain also runs from one to three and 
thus respectively they are swamp as 1 water as 2 and land as 
3 Finally the interaction effect is the interaction of the two 
factors that is causes and terrain respectively The layout of 
the study is seen below

4 ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF 
RESULTS
The stated hypothesis for the study is given as
 
H0  There is no significant difference amongst the causes of 
oil spillage in the Niger delta versus
 
H1  There is more spillage due to some causes more than 
others
From the null hypothesis it means that the causes of oil spillage 
are all equal
Table 2 shows the ANOVA table and the associated results From 
the table below it can be seen that the causes are significant with 
the value 0047 that is there is significant difference at an α = 005 
level of significance thus the causes of oil spillage in Nigerai are 
not equal our concern is on which of the causes actually have more 
impact than the others Is it sabotage operational mystery spill 
or others To achieve this a multiple pairwise comparison would 
be done and thus the cause that is more significant would be seen 
From the table above with 0830 and 0837 it can be seen that the 
terrain isn’t significant and has nothing to do with the oil spillage 
and the interaction ie causes and terrain isn’t significant either 
at an α = 005 level of significance
Table 3 shows the multiple pairwise comparisons from the table 
one can see that the mean differences amongst some of the causes 
are significant For instance the mean difference between sabotage 
and operational causes are significant with the values 0026 and 
the mean difference of 947090 likewise sabotage and mystery 
spill but for sabotage and others there is no significant difference 
This implies that the major causes of oil spill incident are sabotage

operational and mystery spill to some extent because the mean 
differences between sabotage and operational operational and 
sabotage sabotage and mystery spill and finally mystery spill and 
sabotage shows that the sabotage causes are more pronounced than 
the operational and finally the mystery spill
Table 4 shows the terrain that is most affected and from the table 
it can be seen that Swamp is the most affected thus the swamp 
terrain is the incident site with the highest frequency of 328 and 
percentage of 82 followed by water with 46 as its frequency and 
115 and lastly land with 26 and 65 respectively This implies 
that most of the spillages that occurred in the Niger Delta were 
majorly on swampy areas
5 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
It is pertinent to note that oil spillage in Nigeria has created and 
caused a lot of environmental and health problems and from the 
twoway ANOVA it can be seen that sabotage majorly is the 
cause of oil spillage in the Niger Delta irrespective of the terrain 
or incident site Sabotage can be in form of vandalization of oil 
pipes siphoning and so on The issue of oil spillage isn’t a current 
case since as far back as the eighties oil spill incident had been 
on the news and headlines of prominent newspapers
Niger Delta residents can testify that they don’t have access 
to clean water and thus it isn’t drinkable either because their 
streams or rivers are polluted The chemicals released into the 
environments are slowly killing the occupants and indigenes of the 
Niger Delta Thus the federal government of Nigeria and federal 
environmental agencies should enforce the already existing laws 
as regards oil spill management and thus bring to book all the 
perpetrators of these criminal act except this is done and some 
persons are used as scape goats for others to learn The criminal 
act may not stop
