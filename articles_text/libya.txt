  Last Updated May 9 2022 
 
Overview 
• 
Libya was the seventhlargest crude oil producer in OPEC and the thirdlargest total petroleum 
liquids producer in Africa after Nigeria and Algeria in 2021 1 At the end of 2021 Libya held 3 
of the worlds proved oil reserves and 39 of Africa’s proved oil reserves Figure 1 2 Despite 
Libya’s large oil reserves political conflicts and militia attacks on hydrocarbon infrastructure 
have limited investments in the country’s oil and natural gas sectors These challenges have also 
constrained exploration and development of its reserves since 2011  
• 
Although Libya is a member of OPEC it is exempt from the production cuts under the OPEC+ 
agreement 3 Crude oil production is very volatile and is frequently shutin because of conflicts 
labor disputes budget constraints ongoing maintenance issues and insufficient storage 
capacity  
• 
Political instability has continued since Libya’s civil war began in 2011 and continues to pose 
risks for the energy sector Various local militias fought each other but subsequently formed a 
unified transitional government in 2012 The 2014 elections led to a split government with two 
major opposing parties the internationally recognized Government of National Accord GNA in 
the western region and the Libyan National Army LNA in the eastern region The GNA the LNA 
and separate local militias often fought each other and used oil exports as leverage and caused 
massive disruptions to Libya’s oil production between 2014 and 2020 The GNA and the LNA 
signed a ceasefire agreement in October 2020 and formed an interim unity government the 
Government of National Unity GNU in March 2021 45 The GNU scheduled presidential and 
parliamentary elections for late December 2021 However the various parties could not agree 
on election laws and candidates leading to the GNU indefinitely postponing the elections 
Meanwhile Libya’s parliament installed a new interim government and prime minister Fathi 
Bashagha in Tripoli in March 2022 but the previous prime minister of the GNU Abdulhamid al
Dbeibah had not stepped down as of April 2022 resulting in a divided government The United 
Nations is working with factions in Libya to reach an agreement on constitutional laws regarding 
the election process and a list of candidates 6 Political divisions and the postponed elections 
pose significant risks to Libya’s stability and oil output and exports which have been mostly 
stable since the beginning of 2021  
• 
Crude oil and natural gas export revenues are a significant part of Libya’s economy In 2021 oil 
revenues accounted for an estimated 98 of Libya’s total government revenues according to 
Libya’s Central Bank Libya’s oil and natural gas exports accounted for 73 of the country’s total 
value of exports in 2020 7 Real GDP growth fell 31 in 2020 as a result of the political conflicts 
between factions in the eastern and western regions the oil export port blockades and pipeline 
shutins and to a lesser degree the economic slowdown during the global COVID19 pandemic8 
After the GNA and the LNA signed a ceasefire and lifted the restrictions on oil production and 
exports preliminary real GDP growth estimates rose 70 for 2021 9 We estimate that Libya’s 
net oil export revenues totaled 23 billion in 2019 slightly higher than 2018 totals as a result of 
the country’s rise in oil export volumes since 2016 We expect that the oil price declines and 
disruption in Libya’s oil supplies in 2020 significantly reduced its net oil export revenues but that 
the increase in oil prices and resolution of the oil blockades boosted Libya’s oil export revenues 
in 2021 10  
  
 
Petroleum and other liquids 
• 
At the end of 2021 Libya held Africa’s largest proved oil reserves at 48 billion barrels 
representing 39 of the continent’s total reserves Libya ranked in the top 10 countries for 
global proved oil reserves according to Oil and Gas Journal 11 About 93 of Libya’s recoverable 
reserves are located in the onshore Sirte Basin in the northeast and Murzuq Basin in the 
southwest These two basins also account for most of the country’s oil production capacity 12 
Most of Libya remains unexplored and ongoing civil unrest has prevented a largescale 
exploration program 
• 
Libya produces mostly highquality light sweet low sulfur crude oil grades which can be 
processed into petroleum products in simple refineries and are valuable to import markets 
After Libya’s crude oil production excluding condensates reached around 17 million barrels 
per day bd between 2006 and 2010 the 2011 civil war and ensuing political dissention over 
the following decade caused a steep production decline and several major disruptions to 
production and exports We assess that Libya’s maximum crude oil production capacity is 13 
million bd although production often falls significantly short of this capacity Libya’s production 
could return to pre2011 averages if the various political factions could form a stable 
government attract foreign investment for exploration and development projects and provide 
sufficient revenue to strengthen the country’s aging oil infrastructure 13 
• 
After Libya’s crude oil production fell below 400000 bd in 2016 it recovered through 2019 
Severe disruptions in 2020 forced Libya’s crude oil production to fall significantly from 11 
million bd in 2019 to a recordlow 365000 bd in 2020 In January 2020 the eastern 
government’s armed forces blockaded all of the country’s eastern oil export terminals and 
closed the pipelines connecting major oil fields Sharara and El Feel in the southwestern region 
to the coast During most of 2020 Libya’s offshore oil fields were the only ones in production 
and from February through September crude oil production averaged 100000 bd The eastern 
and western governments signed a ceasefire agreement in October 2020 and Libya’s national 
oil company lifted its force majeure on the coastal ports which raised oil production In 2021 
Libya’s crude oil production rose to nearly 12 million bd the highest output since 2012 with 
temporary disruptions to ports and pipelines during certain months because of pipeline leaks 
maintenance issues insufficient funding and labor disputes Figure 2 14  
• 
Libya’s natural gas fields produce condensates and natural gas plant liquids NGPLs which 
contribute relatively small volumes to the country’s total petroleum and other liquids 
production In 2020 production of condensates and NGPLs fell to around 50000 bd from 
100000 bd in 2019 because when most of the country’s oil fields were closed that affected 
some of its natural gas production In 2021 we estimate that condensate and NGPL production 
recovered to less than 100000 bd 15 
• 
Libya’s national oil company NOC plans to bolster oil production to 21 million bd by 2025 16 
To reach this target NOC’s plans include increasing oil production through developing new 
projects rehabilitating fields that were damaged during the conflicts of the past decade and 
increasing power supply to the fields NOC’s subsidiary Zallaf Oil will commission the 
southwestern Erawin oil project in late 2022 where peak oil production will be 16000 bd 
Future plans include connecting the Erawin field with the large Sharara oil field 17 TotalEnergies 
announced in late 2021 its plans to invest in developing the 100000 bd North Giallo project 
and the rehabilitation of the 40000 bd Mabrouk field which militant groups damaged in 
2014 18 Both of these fields are located in the large Waha field concession that is a joint venture 
between TotalEnergies ConocoPhillips and the NOC Other sizeable fields that the NOC plans to 
develop are Gialo III and Block NC98 which are in the eastern Sirte Basin The NOC anticipates 
that more sufficient and reliable electricity generation could add another 125000 bd to crude 
oil production 19 
• 
Despite the numerous challenges to maintaining oil production the NOC did bring online a few 
small fields since the 2020 ceasefire began Agoco a stateowned company and subsidiary of 
the NOC began production from the Sinawin field in late 2020 the first new oil project to come 
online in Libya since 2011 Although initial production was 10000 bd a second phase will add 
50000 bd 20 Agoco also began operating the new Tahara field in the western Ghadames Basin 
near Algeria in February 2022 Agoco expects that the Tahara field will produce a maximum 
capacity of 14000 bd and 22 billion cubic feet per year Bcfy of natural gas 21  
• 
After declining from 2011 through 2015 Libya’s petroleum and other liquids consumption 
remained slightly above 200000 bd each year after 2015 and was 220000 bd in 2021 22 We 
estimate that the shares of gasoline 43 diesel 31 and fuel oil 12 accounted for the 
majority of Libya’s petroleum consumption in 2019 23 
• 
Most of the domestically consumed crude oil is processed in Libya’s refineries and around 
11000 bd of crude oil was used directly in power plants in 2021 24 Libya has five refineries with 
a combined nameplate crude oil distillation capacity of 380000 bd 25  However the country 
produces less than 125000 bd of petroleum products from the 120000 bd Zawiya refinery 
and three smallscale facilities The low plant utilization is the result of damage that occurred to 
some facilities during the civil war and the slow progress made to rehabilitate all of the plants 26 
Ras Lanuf Libya’s largest refinery by nameplate capacity was significantly damaged after the 
2011 civil war and has been offline since 2013 A legal dispute over the damages between the 
joint venture JV owners the NOC and Trasta an Emiratiowned company finally settled in 
February 2022 The arbitration ruled that the NOC did not owe any damage compensation to 
Trasta and could buy Trasta’s 50 share in the JV 27 Although this is a significant step toward 
bringing Ras Lanuf refinery back online the NOC would need to rehabilitate the refinery to make 
it functional 
• 
The NOC is constructing a 30000 bd refinery in southwestern Libya near the Sharara oil field 
Despite the facility’s small size it would be the first refinery to serve southern Libya This region 
is far from the energy demand centers along the coast and it relies on petroleum products 
transported by truck from a far distance on the western coast Construction began in October 
2021 and the NOC estimates that the facility will be completed in about three years 28  
  
  
Exports 
• 
Libya exported nearly 350000 bd of crude oil and condensates in 2020 down from about 11 
million bd from 2019 29 A nearly 800000 bd decline in petroleum production caused by 
disruptions and to a lesser extent a decline in global demand both curtailed exports in 2020 In 
2021 Libya’s crude oil and condensate exports recovered to 11 million bd according to Clipper 
Data 30 
• 
Most of Libya’s crude oil is sold to European countries In 2020 Europe’s imports accounted for 
about 63 of Libya’s crude oil and condensate exports Most of Libya’s exports went to Italy 
Germany and Spain Asia mostly China received an estimated 25 of Libya’s oil exports in 
2020 Figure 3 Although Europe accounts for the largest share of Libya’s oil exports Libya has 
diversified its oil export markets over the past few years with Asia and the Middle East receiving 
greater shares of total shipments 31  
• 
The United States restarted oil imports from Libya in 2004 after sanctions on Libya were lifted 
The United States imported 9000 bd of crude oil from Libya in 2020 only a fraction of the 
63000 bd of crude oil it imported in 2019 Imports from Libya rose to 90000 bd in 2021 32 
• 
According to trade data Libya is a net importer of petroleum products as a result of its low 
operational refining capacity Petroleum product imports rose in 2020 to more than 120000 bd 
from about 100000 bd as a result of refinery closures during the shutdown of both crude oil 
production and export terminals during most of the year 33 
 
 
 
Natural gas 
• 
At the end of 2021 Libya had proved natural gas reserves of 53 trillion cubic feet Tcf the fifth
largest in Africa behind Nigeria Algeria Mozambique and Egypt Figure 4 34 
• 
Nonassociated gas which accounted for more than 80 of Libya’s natural gas production over 
the past decade according to Rystad Energy is from the offshore Bahr Essalam fields northwest 
of Tripoli and the onshore Wafa field in the western Ghadames Basin straddling Algeria 35 Most 
of Libya’s associated gas is located in the onshore Sirte Basin in the eastern region 
• 
Libya’s dry natural gas production fell in 2020 to 438 billion cubic feet Bcf from 500 Bcf in 2019 
Figure 5 36 Output has declined overall since 2014 because the volatile security situation and 
unfavorable regulatory environment have deterred investment and international oil companies 
from developing oil and natural gas fields Also associated gas fields have been offline for 
significant periods of time when the accompanying oil fields are shutin Libya’s NOC plans to 
increase Libya’s natural gas production by reducing natural gas flaring and developing new fields 
to help meet Europe’s growing natural gas demand 37 However Libya’s current political 
stalemate and budget constraints are major downside risks to reaching these goals Oil and 
natural gas projects in Libya are typically delayed for several years because of security 
regulatory and financial challenges  
• 
The NOC started three new natural gas development projects since 2018 in an effort to bolster 
Libya’s natural gas production and offset natural declines from aging fields In late 2018 field 
operator Mellitah Oil and Gas Company partly owned by the NOC brought online the 146 
Bcfy second phase of the Bahr Es Salam field and completed a compression upgrade at the 
Wafa natural gas field to increase the field’s capacity 38 The NOC started operations at the al 
Faregh oil and natural gas field project expansion located in the Sirte Basin in early 2021 This 
second phase adds 66 Bcfy of natural gas and 15000 bd of condensate to production 39    
• 
Additional NOC plans include increasing natural gas production from offshore and onshore 
fields Italy’s Eni and the NOC are developing the offshore project Structures A  E 
development which they expect to produce a maximum of 277 Bcfy and 42000 bd of 
condensates The project is slated to begin production in 2026 40 The NOC has proposed several 
other natural gas development projects notably Atshan in the southwestern region the 
western Hamada Basin project and the offshore Bouri Gas Utilization project but these projects 
are in very early stages of development 41 
• 
Libya’s natural gas consumption totaled 271 Bcf in 2019 or about half of domestic production42 
Figure 5 The power sector drives Libya’s domestic natural gas demand and accounted for 
about 90 of Libya’s domestic natural gas use in 2020 43 
• 
Libya is one of the world’s top natural gasflaring countries according to the World Bank’s 
estimates Libya vented or flared approximately 180 Bcf in 2019 ranking seventh highest in the 
world Flaring decreased in 2020 to 87 Bcf because much of Libya’s associated gas production 
was shut in along with almost all of the onshore oil fields during most of 2020 44 Libya lacks the 
natural gas infrastructure particularly processing plants to capture natural gas from fields 
associated with oil production and to transport it to demand centers or power plants Libya’s 
NOC is in discussions with international oil companies to reduce flaring increase the production 
of marketed natural gas and free up more oil for export 45  
• 
The Greenstream natural gas pipeline connects Mellitah on Libya’s northwestern coast to Gela 
Italy and became the only outlet of natural gas exports after armed conflict from the civil war 
destroyed the country’s sole liquefaction terminal in 2011 Libya’s natural gas exports reached 
around 200 Bcf in 2019 but fell by almost half to 114 Bcf in 2021 46 Demand for natural gas in 
Europe fell during the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 reducing the need for imports Libya’s 
reduced natural gas production and insufficient infrastructure have also hindered exports since 
2019 
 
  
  
 
   
 
Electricity 
• 
At the beginning of 2021 Libya’s Audit Bureau reported that the available capacity of power 
plants was 48 gigawatts GW or 42 of the country’s 115 GW installed capacity Peak demand 
was an estimated 75 GW in the summer leaving a power deficit of nearly 30 GW 47 Since 2011 
Libya has had power outages caused by electricity shortfalls to end users including operators of 
oil and natural gas fields refineries and natural gas processing facilities 
• 
Scheduled power curtailments and unscheduled blackouts occur regularly because of rising 
electricity demand aging and damaged infrastructure lack of maintenance operational 
inefficiencies theft of equipment and at times fuel shortages Heavily subsidized electricity 
tariffs artificially boost power demand beyond what consumers can pay 48 In 2020 severe fuel 
shortages of oil and natural gas caused by the port blockades and civil conflicts led to significant 
electricity blackouts most acutely during the peak summer season These prolonged power 
shortages sparked protests in Tripoli and Benghazi during the summer of 2020 49   
• 
Libya’s electricity generation has declined overall since 2013 and output was an estimated 32 
terawatthours TWh of power generation in 2019 50 Libya fueled nearly all of its electricity 
generation with natural gas 67 and oil 33 in 2019 51 Diesel and fuel oil accounted for most 
of the petroleum used in power plants although electricity stations located at oil fields have 
used crude oil in the absence of imported refined products Because of frequent blackouts 
many businesses in Libya use dieselfired generators as a secondary source of power 
generation 52  
• 
Libya aims to harness more of its associated gas that is currently flared and develop more 
nonassociated gas fields to provide for its growing electricity needs although these goals 
depend on higher investment in infrastructure  
• 
The General Electricity Company of Libya GECOL has announced several power plant projects 
to bolster the country’s available capacity although many are in early stages Three plants are 
under construction and slated to add more than 2 GW to operational capacity in 2022―the 740 
megawatt MW Tobruk plant in the eastern region and the 650 MW Misrata and 671 MW 
Tripoli West plants along the western coast 53 These plants are dualfuel facilities that can use 
natural gas or distillate oil for their fuel supply  
• 
Solar power makes up a negligible amount of power generation in Libya which has no utility
sized plants All of Libya’s solar power is from smallscale ventures such as minigrids at hospitals 
and public lighting projects 54 Libya’s government seeks to diversify its power supply and aims to 
produce 22 of its electricity from renewable power by 2030 55 Although this goal is ambitious 
Libya’s vast solar potential has attracted some foreign investors In addition to its recent 
investment in Libya’s oil and natural gas sectors TotalEnergies intends to develop 500 MW of 
solar power projects in the country 56 Libya has also discussed solar power projects with ENI and 
Shell 57   
• 
Libya which has electricity interconnections with Tunisia and Egypt began to import 
significantly more electric power from these neighboring countries after 2015 Libya’s electricity 
imports reached almost 05 TWh in 2019 58 Egypt plans to expand its interconnection capacity to 
Libya from 240 MW to at least 500 MW however as of April 2022 the expansion date is 
unknown 59
