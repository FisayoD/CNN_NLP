Abstract Over the years the Niger Delta region of Nigeria has always received negative media publicity due 
to its restive youth who under several fronts have been campaigning against alleged pillage of the region by 
the oil companies as well as “neglect” of the region by the federal government of Nigeria The region has also 
been agitating against the “massive destruction” of their farmlands water resources and the general ecology of 
the region occasioned by the activities of oil companies in the region resulting in environmental degradation 
and pollution This study is a content analysis of four mainline newspapers in Nigeria The Guardian 
Vanguard Daily Sun and Thisday It was aimed at ascertaining whether the Nigerian press covers 
environmental pollution and the extent of the coverage in addition to forms of environmental pollution in the 
Niger Delta as covered by the Nigerian press Using random sampling 90 issues of each of the papers were 
selected from 1092 issues within the study period  September 2010 to May 2011 The study found that 
environmental pollution in the region by the press received low coverage The study also revealed that 
environmental issues are largely confined to the inside pages of the newspapers  
Key words coverage degradation environment pollution waste disposal

Introduction 
One of the greatest problems facing the Niger Delta region in Nigeria is that of environmental pollution 
which causes great damages to the earth Environmental pollution takes place when the environment cannot 
process and neutralize harmful byproducts of human activities in due course without any structural or 
functional damage to its system 
 
Pollution occurs when the natural environment is unable to decompose the generated elements and on 
the other hand when man fails to decompose these pollutants artificially This has negative impacts on crucial 
environmental services such as provision of clean water and arable land without which life on earth as we know 
it would be difficult 
 
Environmental pollution is a problem both in developed and developing countries Factors such as 
population growth and urbanization invariably place greater demands on the environment and stretch the use of 
natural resources to the maximum Such overuse of natural resources often results in nature‟s degradation  
 
The environment is said to be polluted when there is substantial alteration in form and function of the 
components of the physical environment which in turn produces harmful effects on human beings The key 
word here is “substantial” which is used to show that no component of the physical environment can be 
considered to be polluted until it has been altered in form or function in such a way that it can immediately or 
potentially harm human beings directly or indirectly 
 
In Niger Delta region of Nigeria one of the threatening environmental problems prevalent in the area is 
environmental pollution caused by oil exploration and related activities As an oil producing region oil spillage 
is one of the most outstanding causes of water and land or soil pollution while air pollution is mostly caused by 
gas flaring and industrial effluents The direct impact of oil exploration in the region has been felt by everyone 
living in the area  Some of these issues include ecological degradation environmental pollution associated 
human rights abuses high inflation and loss of livelihood The popular argument is that it could only be fair if 
these groups of people are appropriately compensated 
Niger Delta according to Ashong and Aniefiok 2007195 1 is of two classifications namely physiographic 
core Niger Delta and oil producing Niger Delta The core Niger Delta includes states like AkwaIbom 
Bayelsa Cross River Delta Edo Ondo and Rivers The Niger Delta as currently defined by government 
comprises Abia AkwaIbom Bayelsa Cross River Delta Edo Imo Ondo and Rivers states with a total of 185 
local government areas and a combined population of  over 28million persons  
 
The mangrove forests of the Niger Delta are important ecological resource as they provide essential 
ecosystem including soil stability medicines healthy fisheries wood for fuel and shelter tannins and dyes and 
critical wildlife habitats  Oil spills contribute to degradation and destruction of the mangrove forests

Endangered species such as Delta elephant the white monkey the river hippopotamus and crocodiles are 
increasingly threatened by the activities of the oil companies 
 
The issue of man‟s insensitivity to his environment was considered so important by the United Nation 
General Assembly that in 1984 it set up a body known as the World Commission on Environment and 
Development WCED to formulate a global agenda for a positive change in this area Back home in Africa the 
first African Ministerial Conference on the Environment AMCEN held in Cairo Egypt came up with what 
they called the Cairo Programme for African Cooperation which among other things emphasized the need to 
combat environmental degradation or pollution Onumonu 1986 
In Nigeria Federal Environmental Protection Agency FEPA was established by decree No 58 of 1998 to 
ensure the protection of the environment from the abuse of the oil companies This led to the setting up of 
similar agencies in the states of the federation The Agency FEPA became a full fledge Ministry Federal 
Ministry of Environment in 1999 saddled with the responsibility of protecting Nigerian environment and 
conserving her resources as well Other institutions set up by the government include Department of Petroleum 
Resources charged with the responsibility of ensuring compliance to various regulations on oil Adeyanju 2004 
2 
 
These bodies are charged with maintaining environmental friendliness through monitoring and 
coordinating human activities at the international national and local levels They are to sensitize and persuade 
individuals groups and organizations on dangers of less environmental friendly attitudes and to regulate man‟s 
activities on the environment as well          
 
However the problem still remains how the activities of these bodies agencies and ministry are 
reported upon or gets to the publics to achieve the intended results Thus this study was aimed at finding out if 
Nigerian press covers environmental pollution in the Niger Delta  
 
The press as the watchdog of the society is expected to draw attention of the public the government 
and organizations to environmental problems around them one of which is environmental pollution It is against 
this backdrop that the study seeks to investigate press coverage of environmental pollution in the Niger Delta 
region of Nigeria using content analytical research method The study spans from September 1 2010– May 31 
2011

Problem 
Years of insensitivity to environmental issues or near complete lack of attention to environmental 
concerns have turned the Niger Delta into one of the most endangered ecosystems in the country Various forms 
of ecological activities go on in the region Prominent among them is oil exploration This has led to springing 
up of industries whose activities also generate wastes which are not properly managed and result in 
environmental pollution 
 
Since there is a great link between awareness or knowledge and action socially responsible media in 
their reportage can make issues to be seen as important at a given time in a given society by placing emphasis on 
such issues This could be through frequency of reports prominence given to the reports and analysis of the 
issues at stake Thus this study sought to ascertain the position of the Nigeria press in this regard

Incidences of Environmental Degradation 
In a recent United Nations Environment Programme UNEP 2011 analysis on Ogoniland UNEP 
scientists found an eight centimeter layer of refined oil floating on the groundwater which serves wells in the 
area This was reportedly linked to an oil spill which occurred more than six years ago Ajaero 2011 20 3 
 
In Niger Delta farmlands mangroves fishes drinking waters are gone due to oil spills leading to 
degradation of the ecosystem Soil on farmlands are  turned cakes of crude oil fishes are gone due to polluted

 Presenting the UNEP Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland in August 4 2011 Ibranhim Thiaw 
UNEP Director Division for environmental policy noted that it took more than 14 months to do the report 
during which period 200 locations were visited 122 kilometer pipeline rights of way surveyed 5000 medical 
reports examined and 23000 people were interacted with at local community meetings According to UNEP 
given the dynamic nature of oil pollution and extent of contamination failure to begin addressing urgent public 
health concerns and commencing a clean up will only exacerbate and unnecessarily prolong the Ogoni people‟s 
suffering Ajaero Supra  
 
   According to UNEP reports full environmental restoration of Ogoniland will take an estimated time 
of 25 to 30 years and would need N150 billion This will be possible through a combination of modern 
technology to clean up contaminated land and water ways backed up by practical action at the regulatory 
operational and monitoring levels the report suggested Ikuomola 2011 August 58 4

Well Blowouts 
According to United Nations Environment Programme UNEP “blowouts” is oil industry terminology 
for a situation in which control of oil well is lost during drilling or operation More frequent during drilling 
blowouts lead to the release of hydrocarbons crude oil produced water and associated gas into the 
environment Often such mixture will catch fire and burn until such times the well is brought back under 
control Blowouts could be caused by pressure corrosion and illegal tapping leading to oil spills and fires Such 
fire or spill can take months before it could be brought under control Bellow is a picture of a well blowout

In 1975 Shell BP leaked 600000 barrels of crude oil into the seas of Forcados terminal and in 1980 
200000 barrels of crude oil were spilled as a result of Texaco oil well blow out Between 1997 and 1998 more 
than 900000 barrels crude oil were spilled as a result of rupturing in Escravos terminal of Delta State  Ogboi E 
in Kperegbeyi et al 2005119 5 
 Recently on January 16 2012 there was another blow out at Chevron‟s Funiwa Field 10 kilometres 
offshore This has become the latest in the series of environmental disasters in the Niger Delta due to oil and gas 
related operation This will bring about steaming temperatures acidification of the waters and air miles around 
the natural gas rig thus causing a great damage of marine life Communities affected by the blow out are 
Koluama I and II Sangana Foropa Bisangbene Ezetu and others all in Bayelsa State 
 
61 Equipment failure This is another oil spillage factor which could result from poorly maintained 
equipment used in oil exploration and transportation In May and December 2001 pressure surge valve of 
Exxon Mobil and SPDC opened due to equipment failure causing Qua Iboe terminal Tank Farm spill and 
Umudike II spill in Ohaji Egbema Local Government of Imo State    
 
62 Abandoned oil facility 
An abandoned oil facility in the Niger Delta is another cause of environmental pollution in the area In 
Ogoniland for example some containers are left lying around since SPDC were forced out of the area some 
years ago Where such containers are not empty there are no indications of the contents Tampering with such 
facility may lead to fire outbreak From the environmental point of view UNEP notes that corrosion of such 
metallic objects leads to ground contamination by heavy metals 
 
63 Artisanal Refining 
Artisanal refining means local and crude way of refining petroleum products This involves the use of 
metal drums to boil crude oil whose fumes are collected in tanks through pipes welded together This is common 
in the Niger Delta region where distilleries are heated on open fire throwing dark plumes of smokes into the air 
and increasing the risk of fire outbreak Also soil where such practice took place will suffer contamination from 
hydrocarbons Bellow is photograph showing air pollution resulting from artisanal refining and the resultant 
effect on the land

64 Improper Industrial Waste Disposal 
Industrial wastes are disposed in the region without regard to human life and safety as well as its effects 
on the environment An example is a waste disposed of in several hundred big bags of 1 cubic metre 
reinforcement plastic bags which amounted to 11001500 cubic metres of oil mixed with gray clay containing 
small rock fragments with seeping from the bags forming puddles in the ground and leaching into the soil

65 Sabotage This is a deliberate nefarious human activity on oil pipelines either for the purpose of making 
quick money or willfully making oil companies suffer loss According Ikporukpo 1986 cited in Ekpo 2010 
168 8 sabotage as an oil spillage factor accounts for 3 of the total oil spills world wide and about 33 of 
oil spills in Nigeria For instance in August 2001 several kilometers of the Trans Niger pipeline were excavated 
and cut in sizable lengths for onward transportation to buyers This act spilled oil at BDere and KDere 
communities in Gokana Local Government Area of Rivers State  
Also   in August 2001 ¾ inch plug belonging to Exxon Mobil were removed which led to Qua Iboe terminal 
spill in Mkpanak which affected vegetations farmlands and buildings in the vicinity of the spill point

66 Gas Flaring   
Gas flaring brings about ecosystem heat stress and acid rain Acid rain in turn induces the destruction 
of fresh water fishes and forests Adeyanju 2004 10 In another report Oladejo 199811 in Adeyanju 
2004 12 noted that constant gas flaring in the oil producing areas of Niger Delta contributes significantly to 
the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide which is a major component of green house gases that causes global 
warming phenomenon

Environmental Consequences of Petroleum Hydrocarbons 
United Nations Environment Programme in a recent Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland noted 
the followings about petroleum hydrocarbons and its consequences on the environment In their report 
hydrocarbon is naturally occurring compound comprising hydrogen and carbon Hydrocarbons can be as simple 
as methane CH4 but many are highly complex molecules and can occur as gases liquids or solids The 
molecules can have the shape of chains branching chains rings or other structures Petroleum is a complex 
mixture of hydrocarbons The most common hydrocarbons are natural gas oil and coal UNEP 2011239 13 
Hydrocarbons are formed by the decay of organic substances trapped within sedimentary rocks High 
temperatures and pressure convert the trapped matter into hydrocarbons Liquid hydrocarbon found in nature is 
also referred to as crude oil UNEP 201136 14 
 Looking at the environmental consequences of hydrocarbons it is important to remember that 
„hydrocarbons‟ is an umbrella term used for hundreds of different organic compounds Secondly hydrocarbons 
can cause environmental consequences due to their chemical properties or physical properties The economic 
significance of hydrocarbons as the primary source of fuel and its versatile application in downstream industries 
are obvious the product may also have major environmental consequences Oil exploration production and 
processing represent prime sources of exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons But there are other possible sources

such as vehicle and generator emissions burning of vegetation and trash food processing and use of cooking 
fuels  
 
71 Impacts of Hydrocarbons on Soil 
When hydrocarbons come into contact with the soil they alter its physical and chemical properties The 
degree of alteration depends on the soil type the specific composition of the hydrocarbon spilled and the 
quantity spilled In the least damaging scenario such as a small spill of a volatile hydrocarbon onto dry sand the 
hydrocarbons evaporate fast causing no chemical or physical damage to the soil In other situations for 
example a spill of heavy crude oil onto clay soil the chemicals can remain within the soil for decades altering 
its permeability causing toxicity and lowering or destroying the quality of the soil 
 In such circumstances the soil itself will become a source of pollution Contaminated soil can affect 
the health of organisms through direct contact or via ingestion or inhalation of soil contaminants which have 
been vaporized Soil also acts as a reservoir of residual pollution releasing contaminants into groundwater or air 
over extended period of time often after the original source of pollution has been removed 
 
72 Impacts Hydrocarbons on Water 
The impact of hydrocarbon on water is dependent on the specific chemical composition and physical 
characteristics of the hydrocarbon involved and the degree of concentration or dilution Hydrocarbons can cause 
both physical and chemical effects in water even very small quantities of hydrocarbon can prevent oxygen 
transfer in the water column thus affecting aquatic lifesupport systems The presence of mere traces of a highly 
toxic hydrocarbon such as benzene may render water unfit for human consumption 
 
73 Impacts of Hydrocarbons on Vegetation 
Impacts of hydrocarbon on vegetation depend on a range of factors from the type and quantity of the 
chemicals involved to the lifecycle development stage of the plants concerned and the means through which 
the plants came into contact with the hydrocarbon Different vegetation types also have varying sensitivity to 
hydrocarbons 
 
74 Impacts on Aquatic and Terrestrial Wildlife 
Oil spills can affect wildlife both aquatic and terrestrial in many ways The severity of damage will 
depend on the types of hydrocarbon involved the quantity spilled the temperature at the time of the incident 
and the season Dissolved or emulsified oil in the water column can contaminate plankton algae fish eggs and 
invertebrate larvae UNEP 201138 15 
    
 Physical contact with oil destroys the insulation properties of fur and feathers causing various effects 
in birds and furbearing mammals Heavily oiled birds can also lose their ability to fly as well as their 
buoyancy causing drowning In efforts to clean themselves birds often ingest oil which may have lethal or sub
lethal impacts through for example liver and kidney damage  
 
75 Impacts on People 
People might be exposed to petroleumcontaminated surface water or groundwater when used for 
bathing washing cooking and drinking People of all ages can also be exposed to petroleum that evaporates into 
the air Members of fishing communities risk exposure to petroleum if they drink bathe or collect shellfish in 
contaminated water or if they come into contact with or accidentally ingest contaminated sediment while 
engaged in any of these activities UNEP 201139 16 
For instance a research conducted by the faculty of Pharmacy University of Lagos found a chemical 
benzo a pyrene an alternate polynuclear hydrocarbon in water samples taken from 18 different sites in the 
Niger Delta The chemical according to the researchers in a report published in the Nigeria Quarterly Journal 
of Medicine vol 14 July – December 2004 threatens the lives of the people through exposure to the skin lungs 
breasts and abdominal cancer 
Dermal exposure can lead to skin redness oedema dermatitis rashes and blisters inhalation exposure 
can lead to red watery and itchy eyes coughing throat irritation shortness of breath headache and confusion 
and ingestion of hydrocarbons can lead to nausea and diarrhoea

Literature Review 
A study by BA Chokor 1985 16 on three Nigerian newspapers The Daily Time New Nigeria and 
Concord reported that environmental issues covered by these three newspapers constituted 7 8 and 5 
respectively while over 18 and 24 of the published stories in Daily Times and The Concord was devoted to 
economic issues This is a clear indication that Nigeria media and media practitioners then pay little or no 
attention to environmental issues and problems

wwwiosrjournalsorg                                                             41 | Page 
Also K S Olugbemi 1992 17 in another content analysis on Newspaper coverage of environmental 
issues and problems in Nigeria noted that the newspapers he studied gave inadequate coverage to environmental 
issues and problems in Nigeria Similarly M N Akpa 1995 18 content analyzed four national daily 
newspapers in the topic Newspaper coverage of urban waste and environmental sanitation in Nigeria and 
discovered inadequate coverage of environmental issues in the country 
In the 1990s Ikechukwu  Nwosu 1997 19 studied two government newspapers New Nigerian and 
Daily Times and two privately – owned Nigerian newspapers  The Champion and The Guardian using content 
analysis research method The study revealed among other things that the media in Nigeria did not only 
quantitatively undercover environmental issues and problems but gave low quality coverage of the little they 
published 
Also Nathaniel Anokwute 1999 20 studied the same newspapers analyzed by Nwosu New 
Nigerian Daily Times Champion and Guardian and concluded that the newspapers studied did not give 
adequate coverage and analysis of environmental pollution issues and problems 
In another research work Ashong and Udoudo 2007 21 in a survey of media coverage of environmental 
pollution as a factor in agricultural development in the Niger Delta noted that Nigerians need more information 
on the environmental situation in the Niger Delta On the contrary Onyilo 2011 22 in her assessment of 
press reports on environmental issues in Nigeria studied 4 Nigerian newspapers The Guardian Punch 
Champion and New Nigerian and found out that the press carried favourable and indepth reports on 
environment However the report was silent on the extent of coverage   
 
Furthermore Ashong and Udoudo 2007 23 in their work media coverage of environmental 
pollution as a factor in agricultural development in the Niger Delta interviewed 21 journalists on the barriers 
militating against effective communication on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta and discovered that 
lack of editorial policy non enforcement of environmental protection standards by the government in 
accessibility to information poor terrain and transport problem lack of media commitment and Government 
interference are the factors that hamper effective communication on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta  
From the foregoing there are clear indications that a lot of factors are responsible for the poor coverage of 
environmental issues by the press in the country These in no small measure have affected the perception of 
ordinary citizens on what constitutes environmental risk and how to achieve environmental sustainability 
Man has influenced his physical environment so much through his activities most of which are carried out in 
ignorance of their consequences Hence there is the need for environmental information through enlightenment 
programmes in form of jingles debate symposia and seminars to make man realize that those activities engaged 
by him to produce livelihood and to improve his life must be done with utmost caution Busari 2005 24 This 
would ensure meeting the need of the present generation without compromising that of the future generation 
 
Besides public awareness on environmental issues will intimate man on the effects of some industrial 
operations on his health and the physical environment enlighten him on various environmental laws and 
regulations that are available in our society and inspire a greater sense of respect for the environment Bearing in 
mind that problems of environmental pollution are traced to man‟s activities that accumulate in bits and 
consequently altering his environment negatively environmental information and awareness campaign will 
enlighten the people to understand the consequence of their action to avert any further degradation of the 
environment Akporido 1997 25 and develop a citizenry that is aware of and concerned with the total 
environment Moemeka 1983 in Akporido 2005 26 Also this will bring about much reportage on 
environmental issues in the Nigeria press 
According to Odufuwa 2005 236 27 environmental education should be able to create awareness about 
environmental problems motivate people to devoid from extravagance conserve resources and protect 
environment facilitate understanding and cooperation among people toward sustainable environmental issues 
conserve indigenous knowledge traditions and culture friendly to the environment Such will inspire widespread   
public participation on all fronts and enable all from the grass roots through the relevant agencies to the leaders 
to understand the stakes the urgent need for action and the necessary steps that must be taken towards 
sustainable national environmental protection  Onyelucheya 2003 144 28  
To this end the researcher suggests environmental education as a panacea to dearth of environmental issues in 
our national newspapers lack of awareness on environmental laws ensure compliance to these laws and 
enshrine environmental friendly attitudes 
 
81 Theoretical Anchor  
This study is anchored on social responsibility theory This theory places emphasis on the moral and 
social responsibility of persons and institutions which operate the mass media It owes its origin to Hutchins 
Commission on the freedom of the press set up in the United States of America in 1947 to reexamine the 
concept of press freedom as enunciated in the libertarian theory of the press The thrust of the social 
responsibility theory is that socially responsible press should fulfill certain obligations to the society such as

A Provide the people with information and discussion on important social issues and the avoidance of the 
activities harmful to the public welfare and security of the state 
B That through professional standard of in formativeness truth accuracy objectivity and balance these 
obligations can be met 
C That the media should regulate itself within the frame work of the law and established institutions to be able 
to carry out its responsibilities 
D That based on the principle the society has the right to expect high standard of performance from the 
media 
E That the media should reflect its society‟s plurality giving access to various points of views and grant all the 
right to reply 
Following the tenets of this the press in this case the Nigerian press is to provide adequate and unbiased 
coverage to the issues of environmental pollution in the Niger Delta in furtherance of the region‟s environmental 
sustainability for the good of the Nigerian society

Methodology 
This study adopted the content analysis method in examining the manifest content of four national 
dailies The Guardian Sun Vanguard and Thisday newspapers with a view to finding out the coverage of 
environmental pollution in the Niger Delta by the Nigerian press This design is considered appropriate for this 
study because of its reliability in analyzing relevant media content as well as giving accurate and dependable 
results  
The selection of these three newspapers which was done purposively was based on their high 
circulation and widely diffused market as well as their coverage of all major interest groups in the country 
All the editions of the four newspapers within the period under study constituted the population of study To this 
end a total of 1092 editions constituted the population of study Out of this population a total number of 360 
editions were contentanalyzed 
While purposive sampling was used in selecting the three newspapers content analyzed in this study 
systematic random sampling was used in selecting the issues or editions studied The technique employed here 
picked editions at 3rd intervals using 4 as my random starting point Each of the newspapers has 273 editions 
within the period under study which brings the total editions to 1092 Out of 1092 editions 90 editions each 
from the 4 newspapers were drawn out within the nine months study period Thus a total of 360 editions 
representing 3296 of the total editions 1092 editions were analyzed   
  The manifest contents analyzed are news stories features opinion articles editorials and letters – to 
the editor This manifest content refers to the directly visible objectively identifiable characteristics of a given 
communication Okoro 2001 29 28 
The following content categories were considered in the study during coding 
 
a Nature of story It considers whether the news published by these newspapers within the period under 
study was categorized as news features editorial pictures and cartoons 
b  Frequency of coverage This has to do with the number of times the newspapers under study covered 
stories or issues concerning environmental pollution in the Niger Delta 
c Placement This is the placement of the story in the newspapers under study whether the story is placed in 
front page inside page or back page Placement of story determines their visibility and therefore determines 
whether they are read by the publics or not

given to environmental pollutions in the Niger Delta Firstly it discovered that in spite of the growing rate of 
global concern for the environment Nigerian newspapers are yet to give adequate coverage to environmental 
pollution in the Niger Delta region Secondly it reveals that media treat the issue of environmental pollution 
with levity

On question of the nature of stories published by the newspapers studied it was found out that the 
stories were mostly straight news stories or “deadpan” reports For example 14 or 56 of the stories were 
straight news stories 6 or 24 of the stories were feature stories while 4 or 16 were supplements while a story 
was a letter to the editor on the subject matter From the above table also it could be seen that vanguard news 
tops the list in terms of straight news reports features and supplement on the subject matter 
Also the table indicates that Daily Sun had 3 or 21 and 2 or 33 as straight news and features respectively 
Guardian 3 or 21 as its straight news and had no feature or supplement on the subject matter while Thisday 
had 3 or 21 as straight news and 1 or 17 as feature Above is an indication of low interpretation given to 
environmental pollution in the Niger Delta by the Nigerian Press  
On the question of placement of stories on the pages of the newspapers studied the study showed that all 
environmental pollution stories in the Niger Delta as covered by the 4 newspapers studied were placed on their 
inside  pages Guardian recorded 3 or 12 of the 20 environmental pollution stories in the Niger Delta 
Vanguard had 12 or 48 of the stories on the subject matter on the inside pages Daily Sun and Thisday had 5 or 
20 all on their stories on the inside pages respectively None of these stories made the front or the back pages 
of the newspapers studied 
Above indicates poor placement of stories on the environmental pollution in the Niger Delta as none of them 
were strategically placed on the front or the back pages of the newspapers studied Story placement shows the 
importance attached to stories and determine their visibility visàvis their readability  See the table below

104 Research Question 4 What are the prevalent of environmental pollution forms in the Niger 
Delta as reflected by the Nigerian press 
 
 
On the question of types of environmental pollution prevalent in the Niger Delta as covered by the 
Newspapers studied Guardian Vanguard Daily Sun and Thisday published stories mostly on oil spillage For 
instance out of 25 stories on the subject matter 24 or 96 of the stories were on oil spillage while only 1 of 4 
of the stories published was on gas flaring There was not even a single story on improper waste disposal and 
artisanal refining Also other forms of environmental pollution such as noise pollution had no place in the 
newspapers This is an indication that the root cause of environmental pollution in the Niger Delta is oil spillage 
whether as a result of well blow out rupture or sabotage  See the table below

 This study revealed among other things that the press in Nigeria reports environmental pollution in the Niger 
Delta as shown in the table 5 Though not much coverage is given to the subject matter 
 
On the issue of frequency of reportage given on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta it was 
discovered that in spite of the growing rate of global  concern for the environment Nigerian press are yet to give 
adequate coverage to environmental pollution in the Niger Delta region Again the study revealed a wide 
margin among the 4 newspaper studied in their reportage on the subject matter While Vanguard recorded 12 or 
48 stories in 9 months it will take Guardian 36 months Sun and Thisday and 27 months each to achieve 
Vanguard’s height going by their present rate of reportage on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta This is 
an indication that some media organizations treat the issue of environmental pollution with levity 
 
The study also revealed low interpretation given to the subject matter by the 4 newspapers studied as 
indicated by table 6 Among the 4 newspapers studied Guardian Vanguard and Daily Sun had no editorial on 
the subject matter during the study period While Vanguard through its feature stories and supplements gave 
more interpretation on the subject matter Guardian had no editorial feature or supplements on the subject 
matter Thisday had 1 editorial and 1 letter to the editor Therefore more interpretation should be given to 
environmental pollution in the Niger Delta since such would aid better understanding and appreciation of the 
situation on ground This is because interpreted stories have subtle persuasive content which would help change 
negative attitudes of Nigerians and corporate bodies towards the environment 
 
Furthermore the study revealed poor placement of stories on the environment pollution in the Niger 
Delta as none of the stories was strategically placed on the front or back pages of the newspapers studied Since 
placement of stories determine their visibility and therefore determine whether they are read by readers or not 
the press should consider playing up stories on the subject matter through strategic placement bearing in mined 
that placement given to stories by the media shows the importance attached to these stories Hence the press in 
Nigeria should attach more importance to issues on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta 
 
Finally on the aspect of environmental pollution covered by the newspapers studied it showed that oil 
spillage is the root cause of the environmental pollution in the Niger Delta region There was no story on 
artisanal refining improper waste disposal and noise pollution while gas flaring got only 1 story from the

editions studied From the study it could be deduced that noise has not been seen or recognized as a form of 
environmental pollution in this part of the country even when its implications are enormous   
It was also discovered that out of these 360 editions 334 or 927 of the editions were coded while 26 or 72 
of the editions were missing These missing editions could not be found in the Nnamdi Azikiwe Library UNN 
and Enugu State Library Enugu which were used in the course of this study 
 
Out of the 26 or 72 of the missing editions Guardian had 1 edition missing Vanguard had 2 or 8 
of the editions missing Daily Sun had 3 or 12 editions missing while Thisday had 20 or 76 of the editions 
missing Also out of the 334 editions coded only 18 or 5 of the editions had stories on environmental 
pollution in the Niger Delta Out of which Guardian had 2 or 11 of its editions with stories Vanguard had 8 
or 44 Daily Sun had 3 or 17 editions with stories while Thisday had 5 or 28 editions with stories  
 
     As regards the 316 or 878 of the editions without stories on environmental pollution in the Niger 
Delta Guardian had 87 or 287 of editions without stories Vanguard had 80 or 25 Daily Sun had 84 or 
27 of editions without stories while Thisday had 65 or 20 of editions without stories on environmental 
pollution in the Niger Delta 
 
Above is an indication that Guardian had the lowest number of missing editions editions with stories 
on the subject matter and the highest number of editions without stories on the subject matter as well Thisday 
had the highest number of missing editions while Vanguard had the highest number of editions with stories on 
environmental pollution in the Niger Delta  See the table below

Summary 
Niger Delta region in Nigeria is a region known for oil exploration and related activities It is a region 
faced with environmental pollution one of the threatening environmental problems in Nigeria Prevalent in this 
area is oil pollution resulting from oil spills  which have caused devastation effects on communities around the 
area of spill destroyed aquatic lives vegetations and farm lands 
This exploratory study which looked at press coverage of environmental pollution in the Niger Delta a 
content analysis of 4 national newspapers The Guardian Vanguard Daily Sun and Thisday revealed that 
Nigerian press covers environmental pollution in the Niger Delta though the subject matter did not receive 
much coverage Also the study indicated that interpretations given on environmental pollution in the Niger 
Delta is low expect for Vanguard newspaper that provided little interpretation  through its Tuesday edition 
supplements 
Furthermore it was discovered that all the stories on environmental pollution the Niger Delta were 
hidden in the inside pages of the 4 newspapers studied Not even a single story made the front or the back pages 
of the newspapers studied It was also discovered that Vanguard newspaper had the highest number of 
publication on the subject matter within the 9 months study period while Guardian newspaper had the lowest 
number of stories on the subject matter 
Finally the study revealed that root cause of environmental pollution in the Niger Delta is oil spillage 
even as the researcher tends to believe that environmental education will add impetus to the struggle for having 
a healthy environment as well as sustainable environment

Conclusion 
Niger Delta region is an endangered area threatened by environmental pollution caused by oil 
exploration and related activities whose remediation cost run into billions of naira and would run for over 30 
years Therefore further pollution should be vehemently fought and resisted in order not to reap today and 
compromise the needs of the future generations Since nature sustains its inhabitants and the fate of nature 
depends in human hands there is the need for environmental education to entrench environmental friendly

attitudes better understanding of existing regulations on the environment as well as making of better regulations 
capable of ensuring a healthy environment that meet human needs and support healthy living 
 
Recommendations 
For effective coverage of environmental pollution issues in Nigeria the following steps should 
religiously be followed by the press 
 Media organizations in the country should assign reporters to cover environmental issues in the country on a 
regular basis especially in the endangered Niger Delta region Since issues are seen as important based on media 
attachments to such issues emphasis should be placed on environmental pollution in the Niger Delta through 
frequency of reportage and interpretations 
 Environmental education should be part of the school curriculum from primary to tertiary institutions to 
inculcate in the people environmental friendly attitudes Such environmental education should equally be carried 
out through the traditional media so as to carry along both the literate and illiterate ones in the quest for a 
healthy environment 
 Oil industries operating in the region should ensure regular maintenance of their equipment to avoid 
equipment failure and ruptures capable of spewing thousands of barrels of oil unto the land and under ground 
waters  In case of oil spill immediate clean up of the environment should be carried out while processes of 
remediation should commence without delay  
 Inhabitants of the region should avoid illegal activities such as bunkering and artisanal refining which are 
major causes of environmental pollution in the area Also they should avoid sabotaging oil facilities in the area 
bearing in mind that in case of oil spill it is them that suffers the consequences Dialogue with oil industries 
operating in the area should be their watchword in case of threatening situations 
 Government should ensure strict compliance to existing environmental laws and regulations by operators in 
the oil industry Also regulatory agencies such as Department of Petroleum Resources DPR National Oil 
Spill Detection and Response Agency NOSDRA Federal Environmental Protection Agency FEPA should be 
alive to their responsibilities
