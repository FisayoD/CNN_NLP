ABSTRACT
This paper examines the effect of oil spillage on fish in Nigeria
considering its relatedness to Niger Delta Region It further
isolates types of oil spillage overview of oil spills in the Niger
Delta and causes of the oil spills It also analysed the effects of
oil spillage on fish using descriptive method to obtain logical
deductions and sequential presentation
of facts from the data
obtained to give a clear picture of the problems caused by oil
spillage on fish The environmental and economic effects of oil
spills on the livelihood of the people were reviewed The direct
and indirect effects and the factors that influence the degree of
impact on fish
were discussed
The general socioeconomic
effect on the fish farmers
and poor masses was not left out
Techniques that should be utilized to prevent and control the
situation are suggested and possible recommendations made

INTRODUCTION
Spills are uncontrolled releases of any product including crude
oil chemicals or waste caused by equipment failure operation
mishaps human error or intentional damage to facilities The
extent of damage depends on what where and how much has
been spilled and how long it remains in the immediate and
impacted environment cf SPDC 1997

When we think of oil spills we usually think of oil tankers
spilling their cargo in oceans or seas However oil spilled on
daad often reaches lakes rivers and wetlands where it can also
se
damage Oceans and other saltwater bodies are referred to
as marine environments Lakes rivers and other inland bodies
of water are called freshwater environments The term aquatic
refers to both marine and freshwater environments
When oilis spilled into an aquatic environment it can harm
oIganisms that live on or around the water surface and those that
live underwater
Spilled oil can also damage parts of the food
chain including human food resources Fishes happen to be one

of
the
most
important
organisms
living
in
an
aquatic
environment that oil spillage affect extremely They are very
much vulnerable and susceptible to any slight change in their
eviTonment water
fbeseverity of the impact of an oil spill depends on a variety of
tors
including
characteristics
of the oil itself
Natural
aditions
such
as
water
temperature
and
weather
also
influence the behaviour of oil in aquatic environments Various
• types of habitats have differing sensitivities to oil spills as well

Objective of study
The aim of this paper is to enlighten readers in the various
effects of oil spillage on fish specifically in the Niger Delta of
Nigeria
As
well
as
bring
into
various
perspective
the
mechanism of actions of oil spillage on aquatic organisms
especially
fishes
occurring
in
an
important
reproductive
wetland and marine ecosystem It will enlighten and sensitize
relevant authorities on the problem of oil pollution on fishes
within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with recommendations
Where is NigerDelta
The Niger Delta Region belongs to the SouthSouth geopolitical
zone of Nigeria The NigerDelta region is located in the coastal
part of Nigeria and this is a waterlogged area as more than
eighty per cent of the oil producing communities is on water It
is the most endowed deltas in the world in terms of both human
and material resources Before the discovery
of crude oil
agriculture farming and fishing was the dominantoccupation
of the people with fishery as their basic means of livelihood of
many of them
Before the discovery of oil in the region it was characterized by
natural clean long stretch fresh water and healthy water lettuce
that add beauty and flavour to the environment
As of now oil is the basis of the existence of the Nigerian
nation state In spite of the stupendous wealth that Nigeria has
generated from the production
and sale of oil one of the
negative externalities from the oil industry is marine pollution
occasioned by oil spillage and discharge of effluents These oil
effluents affect the productivities of fish hence this study aim at
discussing the effects of oil spillage on Fish in Nigeria using
Niger Delta region of Nigeria as a case study

LITERATURE
REVIEW
The Concept of Oil Spillage and water pollution
Fish is an inexpensive source of protein and an important cash
crop in many regions of world and water is the physical support
in which they carry out their life functions such as feeding
swimming breeding digestion and excretion cf Bronmark and
Hansson
2005
Water
quality
is determined
by
various
physicochemical and biological factors as they may directly or
indirectly affect its quality and consequently its suitability for
the distribution and production of fish and other aquatic animals
cf Moses 1983 Many workers have reported the status of
water bodies lentic and lotic after receiving various kinds of
pollutants
altering
water
quality
characteristics
physical
chemical and biological AU Jiving organisms have tolerable
limits of water quality parameters
in which they perform
optimally A sharp drop or an increase within these limits has
adverse effects on their body functions cf Davenport 1993
I
Kiran 2010 So good water quality is very essential for
survival and growth of fish As we know fish is an important
protein rich food resource and there has been sharp increase in
demand of fish products due to increasing population pressure in
this century Thus to meet the demand of present food supply
water quality management in fish ponds is a necessary step that
is required to be taken up
The study of the environment

activities

focus Obviously
mans
constant quest to fully
utilize the product of the environment has led to the production
of wastes in such proportions as to threaten the very existence of
certain strategic ecological habitats and directly or indirectly
affects human population According to Sheehan et al 1984
releases into the environment of persistent chemicals lead to an
exposure
level which ultimately
depends
on the time the
chemical remains in circulation and how many times it is
circulated in some sense before ultimate removal
This pollution affects both the renewable and nonrenewable
natural endowments of the affected areas like the case of Niger
Delta These have resulted in so many chaotic challenges which
range from low productivity in both farming and fisheries area
which is the major source of livelihood of people in that region
to youth onrest situation found in that region
Spills are uncontrolled releases of any product including crude
oil chemicals or waste caused by equipment failure operation
mishaps human error or intentional damage to facilities The
extent of damage depends on what where and how much has
been spilled and how long it remains in the immediate and
impacted environment cf SPDC 1997 In the case of crude oil
releases especially where the recipient environment is aquatic
the impacts are in the range of unquantifiable damages to fishes
and other economically important aquatic organisms as well as
the direct and indirect negative effects on the socioeconomic
lives of human settlers whose survival has much to do with the
products of aquatic environment cf Enujiugha and Nwanna
2004 Types of trauma oil pollution can cause fishes and
wildlife animals include skin irritation altering of the immune
system
reproductive
or
developmental
damage
and
liver
disease When large quantities of oil enter a body of water
Page 1152
chronic effects such as cancer and direct mortality of wildlife
becomes more likely
Niger Delta Biodiversity
Niger Delta areas have· an ecosystem that can be said to be
highly diverse and supportive of numerous species of terrestrial
and aquatic fauna and flora as well as human life Eregha and
Irughe 2009 The Niger Delta has been declared as a key zone
for the conservation of the western coast of Africa on the basis
of its extraordinary biodiversity cf Nenibarini 2004
The estimate given by Salau in his work claimed that in Nigeria
there are more than 46000 plant species of which about 205 are
endemic and approximately 484 plants in 112 families are
threatened with extinction as well as many animal and bird
species cf Salau 1993 Another estimate is that 24 out of 274
mammal 10 out of831 birds and 2 out of 114 reptiles known to
exist in Nigeria are endangered cf
WRI 1992The larger
population of the Niger Delta survive on services provided by
the ecosystem agriculture
industry fishing food drinking
water wood shelter medicine employment and aesthetics All
aspect of oil exploration and exploitation has adverse effects on
the ecosystem and the local biodiversity Oil exploration by
seismic
oil companies
involves
clearing
of seismic
lines
dynamiting for geological excavation which affects the aquatic
environment It causes mortality in fauna turbidity in the water
that blockage of gills of the filter feeders in the benthic fauna
reduction
of
photosynthetic

caused
by
the
water
turbidity that reduces the amount of sunlight penetration cf
Kadafa 2012 Oil and gas pipeline have been installed covering
7000km to enhance the distribution crude oil products to other
parts of the country cf Onuoha 2008 The installation of these
pipelines
involved clearing large areas of habitat to make
pipeline tracks These pipelines run across the rainforests and
Page 1153
mangroves
with
incidences
of
leakage
and
rupture
and
accidental
discharges
These
discharges
are
caused
by
vandalism failure of pipeline integrity due to aging and defects
in material Most incidences of the reported oil spillages have
occurred in the mangrove swamp forest which is one of the
most reproductive
ecosystems
rich in fauna and flora cf
Nenibarini 2004
Background
of study and NigerDelta as a Case Study
The major environmental issues in the Niger Delta of Nigeria
relate
to
its petroleum
industry
The
delta
according
to
Wikipedia covers 20000 km2 within wetlands of 70000 km
2
formed primarily by sediment deposition Nigeria has a coastal
line of approximately 85km towards the Atlantic Ocean lying
between latitude 4°15 to 4°50 and longitude 5°25 to 7°37 with
a land mass of about 28000sqkm area within the coastal region
The surface area of the continental shelf is 46300sqkm cf
Kadafa 2012 The coastal areas consist of freshwater swamp
mangrove swamp beach ridges sand bars lagoons marshes and
 tidal channels Nigeria has a total land mass of 923768sqkm

918768sqkm being terrestrial land and 13000 sq km being
aquatic cf CIA World Fact Book The coastal area is humid
with a mean average temperature of 2432°C and coastal area
has an average annual rainfall ranging between 1500 4000m
cf Kuruk 2004 Nigeria has two large rivers the NigerBenue
and the Chad River There are several rivers that channel into
the Atlantic Ocean directly all other flowing waters flow into
the Chad basin or into the lower Niger to the sea eventually cf
Kuruk 2004Home to 20 million people and 40 different ethnic
groups this floodplain makes up 75 of Nigerias total land
mass It is the largest wetland and maintains the thirdlargest
drainage basin in Africa The Deltas environment can be broken
down
into
four
ecological
zones

Extent of the problem Reports on the extent of the oil spills
vary The Department of Petroleum Resources estimated 189
million barrels of petroleum were spilled into the Niger Delta
between 1976 and 1996 out of a total of 24 million barrels cf
Vidal20 10 spilled in 4835 incidents  approximately
220
thousand cubic metres cf The Daily Independent 2010 The
Punch Newspaper on February 20 19912 reported a total of
2796 oil spill incidences recorded between
1976 and 1990
leading to 2105393 barrels of oil spilled The UNDP 2006181
also reported that between 1976 and 200 I 3 million barrels of
oil were lost in 6817 oil spill incidences of which over 70 of
the spilt oil was not recovered cf UNDP2006 and Kadafa
2012  69 of these spills occurred offshore a quarter was in
swamps and 6 spilled on land Some spills are caused by
sabotage
and
thieves
however
most
are
due
to
poor
maintenance by oil companies such as Shell cf Al Jazeera
English 2016 and the recent pipeline bombing
General effect of Oil exploration in NigerDelta
Oil spillage is a global issue that has been occurring since the
discovery
of crude
oil which
was part
of the industrial
revolution
According to Bisina 2006 the oil activities in the area has
resulted
to situations
whereby
complete
polluted
water
is
bequeathed to the children Following the discovery of crude oil
in 1956 by British Petroleum now Royal Dutch Shell at a
village called Oloibiri in Bayelsa state which is located in Niger
Delta cf Onouha 2008 and Anifowose 2008 Nigerian have
come to exposed to environmental
pollution caused by oil
spillage with the commercial production that began in 1958
Page 1155
Studies have shown that the quantity of oil spilled over 50 years
was a least 913 million barrels which is equivalent to 50
Exxon Valdez spills cf FME 2006
Since then oil exploration has continued resulting into what is
termed environmental destruction due to neglect and negative
attitude
of
the
multinational
companies
in
environmental
management
in the area The world
today recognises
the
significance of environmental sustainability to the development
of the nations In fact one of the cardinal objectives of the
Millennium Development
Goals is to ensure environmental
sustainability It then implies that there should be reduction in
environmental pollution cf EreghaIrughe 2009
Components
of Crude Oil
The compounds in crude oil or petroleum are known as organic
because
they are mainly
made
of carbon
The
elemental
composition of a typical petroleum is 8287 carbon 1115
hydrogen 016 sulphur 02 oxygen and 0013 nitrogen
Thus crude oil is primarily hydrocarbon with minute amounts
of
such
other
compounds
as
furans
thiophenes
acids
mercaptans and some inorganic species To say that crude oil or
refined oil is toxic to plants and animals including man hardly
scores any extra point
Types of Oil Spillage
Oil spill is categorized into four groups namely
 Minor spill occurs when the volume of the spilled oil is
less than 25 barrels in inland water or less than 250
barrels on land offshore or coastal water that does not
pose a threat to public health or welfare
Page 1156
 Medium spill takes place when the volume of the spill is
250 barrels or less in inland waters or 250 to 2500 barrels
on offshore and coastal waters
 Major
spill occur when the oil discharged to inland
water is in excess of 250 barrels in offshore or coastal
waters
• Catastrophic
spill
refers
to
any uncontrolled
well
blowout pipeline rupture or storage tank failure which
poses an imminent threat to the public health or welfare
cf Egbe and Thompson 2010
Cause of oil Spillage
In Nigeria 50 of oil spills is due to corrosion of pipelines and
tanker accidents 28 is due to sabbotage and 21  are due to
oil production operations while 1  of the oil spill is due to
engineering drills inability
to effectively control wells failure
of machines and inadequate care in loading and unloading oil
vessels Oil bunkering is also a source of oil spill cf Egbe and
Thompson 2010

Data analysis
The data obtained was analysed using descriptive method to
obtain logical deductions and sequential presentation of facts
from the data obtained to give a clear picture of the problem
EFFECTS OF OIL SPILLAGE ON FISH
In
Ibeno
AkwaIbom
State
for
instance
where
Mobils
operations have reportedly led to the loss of fish populations
along the coast fishing is available only to those who can afford
large boat engines and trawlers to venture into the high seas cf
Egbe and Thompson 2010 The rest of the population must buy
ice fish frozen fish from commercial fishermen a practice
totally unknown a few years back Since market prices are
constantly on the rise many villagers have to go without fish
Only a small sector of the local population
in Ibeno finds
employment in Mobils facilities and thereby earns money to
buy food The same situation goes to Niger Delta The effect of
oil spillage on fish can be therefore categorized into direct and
indirect effects
a
Direct etTects of oil spills on fishes
Oil spills can impact on fish directly through three primary
pathways
iIngestion
 when fishes swallow oil particles
directly or consume prey items that have been exposed to oil
iiAbsorption
 when fishes come into direct contact with oil
and iiiInhalation
 when fishes breathe
volatile organics
released from oil or from dispersants
applied by response
teams in an effort to increase the rate of degradation of the oil in
seawater
i
Ingestion of oil or dispersants can cause gastrointestinal
irritation
ulcers
bleeding
diarrhoea
and
digestive
complications These complications may impair the ability of
Page 1158
animals including fishes to digest and absorb foods which
ultimately leads to reduced health and fitness Ingestion can
occur at multiple levels of the food chain Top predators like
perch Muskie muskellunge pike walleye and salmon may
become vulnerable to large quantities of pollutants through
bioaccumulation the increased concentration of toxins found at
higher level of the food chain
ii
Absorption
of oil or dispersants through the skin can
damage the liver and kidneys cause anaemia suppress the
immune system induce reproductive failure and in extreme
cases cause death The skin of some species may experience
irritation bums and infections Exposure of oil to fish eggs in
the water or sea turtle eggs on beaches can lead to slower
embryonic growth lower hatching rates and developmental
impairments
iv
Inhalation
of volatile chemicals vaporized materials
released by oil floating on the surface commonly
occurs among those species of fishes that need to
breath at the surface of the water Inhalation of these
harmful
materials
can
cause
respiratory
inflammation irritation emphysema or pneumonia
b
Indirect effects of oil spills on fishes
Oil spills can also have indirect effects on wildlife by causing
changes in behaviour relocation of home ranges as animals
search for new sources of food increases in the amount of time
animals must spend foraging disruptions to natural life cycles
i
Changes

SUSCEPTIBILITY
OF FISH TO OIL SPILLS
The vulnerability of various species of fishes to
spill changes as time since the spill increases 
time at the surface of the water will be impacted
early stages of the spill Once the oil begins to wash ashore
species that utilize the shoreline are affected Finally influence
on benthic species begins once the oil particles leave the surface
and become mixed throughout the water column Eggs and
hatchlings are susceptible through absorption If oil pollution
occurred during nesting season say spring which means that
 eggs and hatchlings
are likely to experience
high risk of
exposure to oil spills that occur this time of year
Fortunately mature fish and other animals tend to swim away
from the oil slick and therefore hardly ever cut up in the
pollution problem Fish eggs or roe that have already been
Vllas well as fingerlings or fry are the victims not only by
toxiceifect of the parse but essentially by the fact that oil clings
to the gills of fish and prevents oxygen extraction from water
by them So such fish die of oxygen starvation

Susceptibility of fish to oil spills
The vulnerability of various species of fishes to an offshore oil
spill changes as time since the spill increases Species that spend
time at the surface of the water will be impacted most during the
early stages of the spill Once the oil begins to wash ashore
species that utilize the shoreline are affected Finally influence
on benthic species begins once theoil particles leave the surface
and become mixed throughout the water column Eggs and
hatchlings are susceptible through absorption If oil pollution
occurred during nesting season say spring which means that
eggs and hatchlings
are likely to experience
high risk of
exposure to oil spills that occur this time of year
Fortunately mature fish and other animals tend to swim away
from the oil slick and therefore hardly ever cut up in the
pollution problem Fish eggs or roe that have already been
spawn as well as fingerlings or fry are the victims not only by
toxic effect of the perse but essentially by the fact that oil clings
to the gills of fish and prevents oxygen extraction from water
by them So such fish die of oxygen starvation
DISCUSSION
The magnitude of harm caused to wildlife by oil spills varies
according to a number of factors the amount of exposure of
each animal to oil the pathway through which each animal is
exposed to oil the age reproductive state and health of each
animal the type of synthetic chemicals used by response teams
to clean the spill
a
The
magnitude
of
exposure
The
magnitude
of
exposure an animal has to oil influences the degree of harm
caused such as the amount of time the skin is in direct contact
Page 1162
with oil or the amount of toxic material ingested or inhaled
The more extensive the area an oil spill covers the more
difficult it becomes for animals to avoid the oil particles and the
greater the magnitude of exposure
b
The length of time of exposure
The longer the time
period over which oil is present at the surface the greater the
likelihood of exposure to species that forage at or near the
surface Wave action and prevailing winds can accelerate the
rate of mixing of oil from the surface into the water column
reducing exposure to species that spend time at or near the
surface while increasing exposure of benthic organisms to
smaller particles
c
The route of exposure
The route by which fish is
exposed to oil ingestion absorption or inhalation can also
influence the rate and toxicity of the effects Fishes with varied
diets may have fairly limited contact with oil through the
 ingestion route whereas lowmobility
animals that need to
breathe at the surface will have high rates of exposure through
inhalation due to their limited ability to escape the extent of the
spill
d
The age reproductive
state and the state of health of
fish at the time of exposure
The age reproductive state and
overallhealth of fish may influence the degree of harm caused
by exposure to an oil spill In general eggs larvae and early
juvenile life stages are more susceptible to oil and to chemical
dispersants than adult animals of most species Widespread
mortality of larvae from the year a spill occurs will have long
term consequences for the species due to a reduction of the
capacity of the species to rebound the following year when
fewer reproducing individuals arepresent Also individuals of
Page 1163
lower fitness are likely to be impacted to the greatest extentby
the additional stresses imposed by an oil spill
e
Kind of synthetic
materials
exposed
The types of
synthetic materials used by response teams to clean up or
disperse oil can influence the magnitude of harmful effects felt
by wildlife Materials called dispersants are surfactants that
are often applied to an oil spill site to increase the rate of
degradation of oil The use of these dispersants can reduce
exposure to harmful effects caused by the inhalation of toxic
materials by animals visiting the surface to breathe and can
reduce impacts to shoreline habitats However these materials
may increase the harmful effects of oil on the insulation abilities
of bird feathers Dispersants also cause oil particles to disperse
deeper into the water column where the oil may cause more
harmful effects to benthic animals in deeper waters
Page 1164
From the literature review of the oil exploration and exploitation
activities in Niger Delta of Nigeria there is no doubt that oil
development
activities have contributed
to the growth and
development of the country in general But the oil pollution
caused by spillages from the oil industry located primarily in the
Niger Delta region has caused the massive
destruction
to
farmlands sources of drinking water mangrove forest fishing
grounds and declination of fish crabs molluscs periwinkles
and birds Large areas of mangrove forest have been destroyed
over a wide area affecting terrestrial and marine resources
Some past spills have necessitated the complete relocation of
some communities loss of ancestral homes pollution of fresh
water loss of forest and agricultural land destruction of fishing
grounds and reduction of fish population which is the major
source of income for the Niger Delta peoplecf Tolulope 2004
CAB 2009
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
The Niger River is an important ecosystem that needs to be
protected for it is home to 36 families and nearly 250 species of
fish of which 20 are endemic meaning they are found nowhere
else on Earth cf FME 2006 Oil pollution can be lowered as
well if spills were reduced then habitat and environmental
impacts could be minimized Oil contamination affects the fish
population and affects the farmers that rely on fishing to support
their family Speed restoration
and cleaning is required to
quickly correct these impacts of oil spillage in Niger Delta while
every effort should be made to stop further spillage of oil in this
region
