Abstract 
The Niger Delta region has witnessed environmental impacts arising from oil 
production activities Soil fertility in these areas and the entire marine habitat 
was investigated based on the reoccurring spill incidents in the area to estab
lish the consequences of oil pollution on key performance indicators as well 
as the remedial actions for resuscitation One of the bases of evaluation was 
on the fertility profile of the area impacted by oil spills as compared with the 
areas without oil spills influence A suitable cost effective and environmental
ly friendly technique to handle the pollutions in the Niger Delta region can be 
found in systematic containment recovery clean up and restoration of the 
marine habitat to its initial capacity and status to be able to sustain life once 
again

1 Introduction 
The incidence of oil spillage constitutes serious marine habitats degradation in 
the Niger Delta The area currently faces series of ecosystem depletion as most 
flora and fauna are exterminated Oil spills from the activities in the oil industry 
in the region affect the environment in the operational areas right of ways ROW 
and third party areas These spills are consequent on equipment failures leaks 
from corroded equipment and vandalisation sabotage etc The spilled crude oil

environment animals and humans—and pollutes the environmental media the
reby adversely affecting the ecosystem 
Oil spills in the marine environment can have wide spread impact and longterm 
consequences on wildlife fisheries coastal and marine habitats human health 
and livelihood as well as recreational resources of coastal communities and 
the ancestral heritage Oil spill effects on fish sea birds and other marine life 
are mostly due to the smothering and physical contamination or due to the 
toxicity of the chemical components of the oil upon its release into the envi
ronment 
The fisheries and mariculture sector are impacted by the physical oiling of 
equipment and contamination of seafood leading to tainting and the effects on 
commercial and subsistence fisheries lead to substantial losses The repercus
sions of contaminated seafood on public perception are very serious and require 
restoration of market confidence and public health assurances to move the econ
omy forward in this sector  
The impact of oil spills on coastal and marine environments can be both short 
and long term Kujawinski et al 2020 The degree of the damage caused by an 
oil spill event depends primarily upon the quantity of oil spilt the chemistry 
and properties type of the oil and the sensitivity of the biological resources 
affected  
The impacts also include loss in the productive capacity of soil with implica
tions on living organisms and economically on the people in the polluted area 
and consequently high poverty rate and unemployment  
2 Literature Review 
A number of researches have been carried out on hydrocarbon polluted marine 
environment The studies include Abii and Nwosu 2009 study on the effects of 
oil spillage on soil and Aghalino 2000 on the negative impact of oil activities on 
the marine wild life soil air water and the ecosystem of communities  
The ecological effects include brownish vegetation and soil erosion dead and 
extinction of marine wild life diminishing resources of the natural ecosystem 
fertile land turned barren and adverse effect on the life health and economy of 
the people In Amadi and Ue Bari 1992 study in the rainforest ecosystem in 
Nigeria soil and microbiological properties were evaluated 17 years after oil 
spillage to assess the effects of oil and interrelationship between the hydrocarbon 
utilizing and nitrifying microorganisms in the marine ecosystem The study 
showed that organic carbon total nitrogen carbonnitrogen ratio available phos
phate and exchangeable potassium were high at moderate and high impacted 
zones Also the distribution of aerobic petroleum hydrocarbon utilizing fungi 
and bacteria showed a lesser condition at the moderately impacted zone than 
at the highly impacted zones 
The effect of crude oil pollution on marine environment soil fertility and the 
growth of plants and uptake of nutrients were investigated by Agbogidi Eruotor

and Akparabi 2007 by growing corn on a soil polluted by crude oil The soil 
was analyzed for organic carbon total and available nitrogen extractable phos
phate and exchangeable potassium calcium iron and manganes after each crop
ping It was observed that germination and yields were drastically reduced as the 
level of pollution increased At 42 percent crude oil pollution level the average 
reductions were 50 percent in germination and 92 percent in yield The amount 
of organic carbon total nitrogen extractable phosphate and exchangeable po
tassium iron and manganese increased in the soil with level of crude oil addi
tion while extractable phosphate and exchangeable calcium were reduced The 
poor growth was attributed to suffocation of plants caused by exclusion of air by 
oil and exhaustion of oxygen by increased microbial activity interference with 
plantsoilwater relationships and toxicity from sulfides and excess manganese 
produced during the decomposition of the hydrocarbons 
Wokocha Emeodu and Ihenko 2011 examined the impact of crude oil spil
lage on the ecosystem soil properties and food production in OgbaEgbema 
Ndoni Area in Rivers State Nigeria The results showed that the pH status of soil 
in heavily contaminated and moderately contaminated zones varied from acidic 
pH 40 to neutral pH 60 The chemical properties of soil indicated that per
centage organic matter increased from 134 to 262 available phosphorus de
creased from 15 ppm in control to between 734 and 542 in soil polluted with 
high level of crude oil The result was in line with Amadi and Ue Bari 1992 
and Ogboghodo Osemwota Iruaga and Chikor 2000 
Andrade Cavelo Vega and Marcet 2004 in an experiment on the effect of 
prestige oil on marine salt marsh ecosystem soils in the coast of Galicia North
ern Spain revealed that oil pollution altered both physical and chemical soil 
properties lowered porosity and increased resistance to penetration and hy
drophobicity The crude oil spillage affected the physical chemical and biologi
cal properties of soil and the entire marine ecosystem resulting in low food 
production by reducing the nutrients availability in the soils through increased 
soil acidity and toxicity of crude oil fractions The experiment on the effect of 
poultry manure on maize planted on crude oil polluted soils showed that per
centage growth rate in plant height and yield decreased with increase in crude oil 
contamination Ogboghodo et al 2004  
Crude oil spillage also suppresses seed germination regeneration and restora
tion and caused cellular and stomata abnormalities Gill  Sandota 1976 Ekun
dayo Emede and Osayande 2001 confirmed that in crude oil polluted soils 
possibility of grain yield is significantly reduced by 95 percent compared with 
the control In a study of agricultural land in an oil producing area around Qua 
Iboe River in the Eastern Niger Delta of Nigeria the fouled loamy soil samples 
polluted by crude oil were treated using chemical degreasers and detergents Es
sien  John 2010 The result of the treatments showed a significant effect on 
soil properties and crop growth parameters however recovery level was signifi
cantly higher than the level of degradation except in infiltration rate Soil pH 
increased by 26 in fouled soil attributed to bacterial biodegradation of crude

21 The Marine Habitats 
A habitat is an ecological or environmental area inhabited by one or more living 
species Marine habitats can be divided into coastal and open ocean habitats  
Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes 
in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf Most marine life is 
found in coastal habitats even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent 
of the total ocean Figure 1 describes the configuration and composition of the 
continental shelf showing the coastline the continental slope the continental 
rise and the ocean cavity 
Oil spills frequently kill marine mammals such as whales dolphins seals and 
sea otters Oil coats fur of otters and seals leaving them vulnerable to hypother
mia Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects an oil spill can 
contaminate their food supply 
22 Beaches Marshlands and Fragile Aquatic Ecosystems 
Oil spills coat everything they touch and become unwelcome with longterm ef
fects on parts of every ecosystem they have contact with When an oil slick from 
a large spill reaches a beach oil coats and clings to every rock and grain of sand If 
the oil washes into coastal marshes mangrove forests or other wetlands fibrous 
plants and grasses absorb oil which can damage plants and make the area un
suitable as wildlife habitat Fukuyama et al 2014 
When oil eventually stops floating on the water’s surface and begins to sink 
into the marine environment it can have similar damaging effects on fragile

underwater ecosystems killing or contaminating fish and smaller organisms that 
are essential links in the global food chain 
Despite massive cleanup efforts following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill for 
example a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin
istration NOAA found that 26000 gallons of oil were still trapped in the sand 
along the Alaska shoreline Confirming the recalcitrant nature of crude oil im
pact Shigenaka 2014 
23 Birds 
Oilcovered birds are a universal symbol of environmental damage wreaked by 
oil spills Some species of shore birds might escape by relocating if they sense 
danger in time some may not Some sea birds that swim and dive for their 
food are most likely to be covered in oil following a spill are likely vitims Oil 
spills also damage nesting grounds potentially causing serious longterm ef
fects on entire species The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon offshore oil spill in 
the Gulf of Mexico for example occurred during prime mating and nesting 
season for many birds and marine species and longterm environmental con
sequences of that spill won’t be known for years Oil spills can disrupt migra
tory patterns by contaminating areas where migrating birds normally stop Gulf 
Oil Spill 
Even a small amount of oil can be deadly to birds By coating feathers oil not 
only makes flying impossible but also destroys birds’ natural waterproofing and 
insulation leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia or overheating As birds fran
tically preen their feathers to restore their natural protections they often swallow 
oil which can severely damage their internal organs and lead to death The best 
estimate of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is that it killed 250000 seabirds Carson et 
al 1992 Haney et al 2014 Figures 2ac clearly shows the degree of im
pacts on birds after being oiled during oil spill incident 
The laughing gull was by far the most affected with 32 of the entire north
ern Gulf of Mexico population killed because of the spill 
An oiled seabird was found dead on the beach following the Kuroshima oil 
spill near Dutch Harbor Alaska in November 1997 NOAA 
24 Marine Mammals 
Oil spills frequently kill marine mammals such as whales dolphins seals and 
sea otters Oil can clog blowholes of whales and dolphins making it impossible 
for them to breathe properly and disrupting their ability to communicate Oil 
coats fur of otters and seals leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia 
Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects an oil spill can 
contaminate their food supply Marine mammals that eat fish or other food ex
posed to an oil spill may be poisoned by oil and die or experience other prob
lems 
The Exxon Valdez oil spill killed 2800 sea otters 300 harbor seals and up to

spill scientists noted higher death rates among sea otters and other species af
fected by the spill and stunted growth or other damage among additional spe
cies Thirtyfive years after the disaster researchers have found that the Prince 
William Sound ecosystem seems to have finally recovered and localized effects 
on sea otters appear to have been resolved Fukuyama et al 2014 
Long after the spill impacts persist on marine mammals leading to more dead 
threat of species extinction or stunted growth or other damage among other spe
cies as shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b Potential respiratory damage 
hypothermia and other cellular injuries are eminent as a result of the oil spill 
impact

larly if many fish eggs or larvae are exposed to oil Shrimp and oyster fisheries

Horizon oil spill Similarly the Exxon Valdez spill destroyed billions of salmon 
and herring eggs Fisheries impacted by the Exxon Valdez took over three dec
ades to recover QuintanaRizzo et al 2015 
The shrimp and oyster fisheries are usually the first casualties of marine oil 
spills In most cases the fisheries hardly recover Fish are affected through con
tacts with the gills by ingestion or by eating oiled prey The oil contains poly
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs which are the most toxic components of 
oil Oil vapors can cause damage to an organism’s central nervous system liver 
and lungs Spilled oil can also have longterm reproductive problems in organ
isms that have been exposed to oil Fukuyama et al 2014 Fishes are very sus
ceptible to oil spill impacts as shown in Figure 4 The severity most often result 
to death deformation and extinction of species 
32 Cetaceans 
A deadly toll on dolphin and whale populations contributed to the largest and 
longest marine mammal mortality event ever recorded in the area Between 2010 
and 2014 there were 1141 cetacean strandings recorded in the northern Gulf of 
Mexico with 95 found dead Bottlenose dolphins especially were killed both as 
a direct result of oil pollution and from longterm adverse health effects Studies 
on the species conducted from 2010 to 2015 found that reproductive success 
rates for bottlenose dolphin females were less than a third of those in areas not 
impacted by the spill Kellar et al 2017 
33 Wildlife Habitat and Breeding Grounds 
Spill have both acute shortterm impacts on wildlife and environmental health 
and longterm effects that persist for a longer period Schwing et al 2015

Figure 4 Oil spill impacts on fisheries 
 
Longterm damage to species and their habitats and nesting or breeding grounds 
is one of the most farreaching environmental impacts caused by oil spills Even 
species that spend most of their lives at sea such as various species of sea turtles 
must come ashore to nest Sea turtles can be harmed by oil they encounter in the 
water or on the beach where they lay their eggs their eggs can be damaged by oil 
and fail to develop properly and newly hatched turtles may be oiled as they scur
ry toward the ocean across an oily beach 
Ultimately the severity of environmental consequences caused by an oil spill 
depends on many factors including 1 the amount of oil spilled The more the 
quantity of oil spilled into the environment the more devastating the conse
quences on the ecosystem 2 Type and weight of oil The oil viscosity and the 
emulsification factor of the oil will determine the weight of oil 3 The location 
of the spill The spill location will also determine the severity of impact on the 
environment 4 Species of wildlife in the area Some species are quite adapta
ble to spills while some cannot survive and will die from the impact 5 The 
timing of breeding cycles and seasonal migrations There will be more severe 
impact on the organisms if the spill incident coincide with the breeding cycles 
as well as the migration period and 6 even the weather at sea during and after 
the oil spill Harms et al 2019 A typical marine habitat is a beautiful envi
ronment the opposite is the case when impacted with oil spill as shown in 
Figure 5 
There are many important factors relating to the impact of an oil spill on 
wildlife 
• the spread of the oil slick 
• the type of oil spilled its movement and weathering characteristics 
• the location of the spill 
• the area of estuary sea and foreshore impacted by oil 
• the sensitivity of the regional environment eg proximity to bird breeding co
lony 
• the timing of the incident during seasonal breeding bird migration 
• the nature toxicity and persistence of the oil and

• the variety of species at the spill location 
Ultimately the severity of environmental damages caused by a particular oil 
spill depends on many factors but oil spills usually are always not a welcomed 
development for the environment Figure 6 shows the Environmental Impact of 
1989 Exxon Valdez Spill Incident on the Marine Ecosystem 
34 Recovery Rate of the Marine Habitats 
The recovery rate of the marine habitats upon impacts as a result of oil spill in
cidents is a function of the fate of oil dynamics in the ecosystem The Lagrangian 
Model PETROMAR3D will be very useful in evaluating and simulating the in
teraction interface between the key parameters such as the characteristics of the 
type of oil marine environment and the spill itself in managing the Complex 
Processes in Marine Oil Spills Calzada et al 2021 
In most cases recovery typically takes place within a few seasonal cycles and 
for most habitats within one to three years But mangroves takes longer time for 
recovery because of its high sensitivity to oil spills impacts as shown in Table 1 
35 Economic Impact 
Economic impact of oil spills on the fisheries and the tourism industry as always 
been very devastating 
Salmon and herring fisheries lost income not just in 1989 but were hardest hit 
in 1993 as a result of oil spills when the eggs that had been laid was destroyed 
by spill and could not reach adulthood One estimate puts the cost at 300 mil
lion of economic harm to more than 32000 people whose work depends on fi
sheries Fukuyama et al 2014 
It’s hard to put a number on the value of the thousands of animals that have 
been killed by spills but there were some estimates made for the perunit re
placement cost of seabirds mammals and eagles that value was 28 billion for 
the Exxon Valdez spill 
Tourism spending decreased by 35 in southwest Alaska in the year following 
the spill and visitor spending resulted in a loss of 19 million to the Alaskan 
economy

Two years after the Exxon Valdez spill the economic losses to recreational 
fishing were estimated to be 31 million 
Exxon spent over 38 billion to clean up the oil spill which covered paying 
people directly to do jobs like wash off wildlife and spray oilcovered beaches 
but also compensated 11000 local residents for income loss That amount also 
included fines Carson et al 1992 
After most of the worst oil spill incident occurred serious environmental 
protection campaign was initiated and driven The result was drastic reduction 
in the number of spills and quantity of spills from 1970 to 2016 as shown in 
Figure 7 
4 Conclusion 
A wide range of highly complex ecosystems exist within the marine environment 
and substantial fluctuations in abundance and diversity occur as a feature of 
their normal functioning The marine environment is usually the receptacle to 
oil pollutions and other pollutants discharge  
The marine environment has a strong capacity for natural recovery from se
vere perturbations caused by natural phenomena as well as oil spills however 
depending on the volume of release may be overwhelmed thereby impacting on

the recovery rates 
The key mechanisms for environmental damage from oil spills are smothering 
and toxicity but the severity of the damage depends very much on the type of oil 
spill and how volume released time of season of release and timely response 
helping the oil dissipate relative to the location of resources sensitive to oil pol
lution 
The most vulnerable organisms are those found on sea surface or shorelines 
Saltmarshes and mangroves are the most sensitive shoreline habitats in the ma
rine ecosystem 
Seabirds are particularly at risk some species and penguins in particular re
spond well to cleaning however others may not survive for long when released 
back into the wild ecosystem after cleaning or may have difficulty breeding suc
cessfully  
Although short term impacts can be severe lasting damage is usual even fol
lowing the largest incidents where observed long term damage has been re
stricted to geographically discrete areas where conditions have permitted accu
mulations of oil to persist and therefore continuous monitoring and evaluation 
become necessary 
Effective planning and execution of response operations both mitigate damage 
and provide the first step to recovery by the removal of oil and adequate cleanup 
operations followed by welldesigned reinstatement measures which enhance 
natural recovery processes
