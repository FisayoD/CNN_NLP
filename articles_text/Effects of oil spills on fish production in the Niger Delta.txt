BELLO Adesina Temitayo PhD NWAEKE Treasure Amarachi  
ABSTRACT 
 The article highlights and explains the environmental impacts of oil exploration and 
exploitation in Nigeria using Niger Delta as a case study The environmental impacts discussed 
are negative impacts and they can also be described as oil conflicts This borders around 
damages made in Niger Delta and how they can be curbed using existing protocols rules laws 
and organizations by preventing further damages of the flora and fauna bodies in the Niger 
Delta  The article finds that curbing the oil conflicts in the Niger Delta has been sabotaged by 
both the companies involved with exploration and the government at large It concludes that oil 
conflicts can be curbed or even totally eradicated if everyone shows concern in the 
implementation of the laws and regulations provided as a result of the conflicts

BACKGROUND OF STUDY 
The impact of exploration with reference to Niger Delta is germane and calls for concern 
OIL AND THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY 
From the creation of Nigeria in the year 1914 to the end of colonialism agriculture remained the 
chief source of the economy During the colonial period from 19141959 Nigeria was exploited 
for its agricultural products The major products were cocoa from the west groundnut and cotton 
from the North and Palm oil from the east with Niger Delta inclusive Oil exploration began in 
1956 in Nigeria but was not significant in the Nigerian economy until early 1970 Revenue from 
oil in the early 1960’s accounted for less than 10 per cent of Nigeria’s revenue base1 
The Oil and Gas Journal of 2005 estimated Nigeria’s oil reserves to be at 352 billion barrels In 
Feb 2005 Nigeria announced the award of 5 oil blocks in the Joint Development Zone shared by 
the neighboring areas such as Sao Tome and Principe The JDZ at the time held reserves of 11 
billion barrels and could yield up to 3 million barrels a day Nigeria also had an estimation of 
176 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves where the country would have done one of 
the top ten natural gas endowments in the world and the largest endowment in Africa 
DEMOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY 
Niger Delta is a large area of southern Nigeria which houses close to 30 or more people The 
major states in Niger Delta include Rivers Bayelsa and Delta where most of our research work 
is based on Its surrounding states include Akwaibom Cross River and Edo The Niger Delta is 
biodiverse with its mangroves providing carbon sequestration capacity and it permits a wide 
range of plant variety and animal life as well as agriculture and fishing which tends to be their

reliance for their livelihood When discussing the possible oil conflicts in relation to Niger Delta 
we can’t help but mention or lay emphasis to the problem statement of the disastrous impacts on 
the Niger Delta environment Oil exploration and exploitation has been on going for decades in 
the Niger Delta and as such made the reality in that region an uninteresting one as it has affected 
people adversely in that region We should also take to cognizance the fact that the indigenes live 
there and most of them have 95 of their lifetime achievement in that area still2 
Niger Delta consists of diverse ecosystem of mangrove swamps fresh water swamps rain forests 
and is actually the largest wetland in the whole of Africa amongst the ten important wetlands in 
the world Though this is a fact to be proud of Nigeria in itself due to ignorance and negligence 
has not taken cognizance to this and due to that oil pollution which is the major disaster there 
now makes this wetland to be characterized by contaminated streams and rivers forest 
destruction and biodiversity loss in general In return the effect of this bounces back on the 
indigenes as most of them as earlier mentioned have their lives dependent on the ecosystem 
services With the effects of this environmental impact on the indigenes there has been an up 
shoot of abject poverty of most of them It is no news that the oil industry located within this 
region has contributed immensely to the growth and development of the country which is a fact 
that cannot be disputed but unsustainable oil exploration activities has rendered the area almost 
inhabitable and it now takes the place of one of the five most severely petroleum damaged 
ecosystems in the world Previous studies have shown that the quantity of oil spilled over 50 
years was at least 913 million barrels which is equivalent to 50 Exxon Valdez Spills

The oil industry is mainly confined into the offshore and onshore parts of the Niger Delta The 
industry is usually considered to be divided into distinct classes of the upstream and downstream 
sector3 
 The upstream sector This is basically exploration services carried out within the oil 
wells They include prospecting production and transportation of oil which in simpler 
terms mean the searching for of oil deposits in commercial qualities the actual pumping 
of the discovered oil out of the ground and the movement of the unrefined crude oil to the 
refineries4 
 The downstream sector  This is the most important stage where the oil is now refined 
into various products like petrol diesel kerosene etc This is the most important stage 
because it is the stage where the crude oil is transformed into its most valuable stage The 
actual stage that makes oil exploration a very lucrative business After this stage the 
refined products are transported to customers by pipelines sea road and rail tankers 
These activities have adverse effects on the flora and fauna of these oilrich areas These 
effects and their remediation is the basis of this research5 
OIL ACTIVITIES AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT 
 Oil Pollution 
The World Health Organization explains pollution to be when the environment is altered in 
composition or conditions directly or indirectly as a result of the activities of man on it It leads 
to air land and water pollution thereby rendering them unsafe for human use Irrespective of the

preventive measures including technical and manual international and national mistakes that 
warrant oil spillage are still bound to happen as accidents always happen It has also been proven 
that all activities of the oil industry have negative effects respectively on the environment6 
 Physical Pollution 
This happens in the preparation of the well site because a lot of trees will have to be cut down 
which is known as deforestation and this act in turn affects the terrestrial ecosystem This act 
also leads to the exposure of the soil surface and then in turn males the soil nutrients diminish 
and by extension a reduction in agricultural activities happens This was first observed in the 
1960’s when surveyors started clearing forests and swamps7 
 Noise Pollution 
During prospecting the most reliable exploration tool used in the soil industry is the Seismic 
technology It creates seismic waves at the subsurface of the earth While this equipment is used 
explosives and fire electrical devices are also used simultaneously for the effectiveness of the 
equipment and this in conjunction with the first mentioned has led to the flee of the fauna in 
other words the migration of the animals This in general poses as a threat to the environment 
because the animal waste that would have been used to enrich the soil as manure and fertilizer is 
nowhere to be found in some areas The agricultural potentials have therefore been reduced as a 
result of this It is also a fact that the noise generated from the above oil exploration acts 
mentioned above affects both animals and man especially if close to residential areas 
competitively8 One would think that there’s an end to this but production never ends and as 
such the assurance that the noise will end as well is not guaranteed even if it stops someday a

lot of damage would have been caused already The noise in question also results from the 
vibrations of all other mechanical movement of components of the drilling ring9 
 Air Pollution 
Under the negative impacts of oil and gas the aspect solely responsible for air pollution is Gas 
flaring Gas flaring associated with oil production in the Niger Delta is generally unsafe for 
natural ecosystems and biodiversity It contains more than 250 toxins The implication of Gas 
flaring in Nigeria includes the fact that 100 losses of crop produce cultivated 200 meters away 
from the Izombe Station Leakages and fire accidents are also associated with gas production and 
transportation For instance the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas NLNG Pipeline from Kala
Akama and Okrika mangrove Swamps in Niger Delta leaked and caught fire This fire burned 
uncontrollably for 3 days and caught across local plants and animals inhabiting the affected area 
were killed10 
 Chemical Pollution 
Prospecting causes topsoil destruction and chemicals get infiltrated in the aquifers This 
generally has led to the degradation and alteration of the ecosystem in the environment and also 
it has led to the total destruction of the mangrove forest in Igbokoda area of Ondo state in 1988 
1989 Oil production pollutes the environment when chemicals have been dumped or come in 
contact with the soil or even from the drilling of mud and oil around well heads Other sources 
of chemical pollution happen when a valve has failed around flow stations and also during 
material failure along pipelines This kinds of pollution also happens off shore but the most 
affected areas are the swamps because these are like stagnant water bodies and the chemicals or 
oil spills into it and are covered by oil and oil associated chemicals This results to damage the

ecosystem as fishes birds and other animals in the vicinity are killed or frightened away leading 
to the loss of sanctuaries and natural animal habitats  In all of this due to the polluted and 
destroyed environment food chain has been somewhat truncated and this sometimes has a toll on 
the health of both humans and animals11 
 Oil Transportation 
One would ask or wonder how this results in pollution To be able to answer this question or 
settle the curiosity that comes with it We should be able to answer or tell how oil is usually 
transported by pipelines and tankers Oil transportation by pipelines on land or through sea is a 
serious and possible means of pollution and this firm of pollution results from seepage or 
leakage or the breaking of pipes as a result of wear and tear or by a person whether mistakenly 
or intentionally and this is very common in Niger Delta From the quantity of spilled oil it can 
be determined whether or not the pollution could be slight or massive The direct physical 
chemical or fire damage caused by this pollution always alters the ecosystem permanently Gas 
crude oil and other transportation or other products could also be by land tankers or by sea This 
could also pollute the water either by little wash always or sips into huge spillages as a result of 
ship accidents such as the Armoco Cadiz Spillage of 1979 and the Exxon Valdez Spillage of 
1980’s12 This results also in the destruction of the flora and fauna and results in irreplaceable 
damage to the ecosystem13

In the downstream sector refined products are less destructive than the actual crudes but 
generally speaking leaking pipelines and tanker collision can lead to loss of lives due to the 
combustible nature of refined petroleum products Used oils like naphthalene result sometimes in 
contamination of the environment due to careless dumping Farmlands become degraded and 
water bodies remain polluted especially the stagnant ones this in turn reduces the fishing and 
environmental activities  Part of our main findings includes the investigation by Ukpong in 
2001 It discovered that Niger Delta Ecosystem at various locations from the viewpoint of 
sustainable agriculture fishing and environmental quality The study showed a high level of 
degradation in areas of oil exploration and their effects on plants and animals This highlights a 
vivid fact that communities where oil activities take place are subjected to environmental abuse 
and as such needs redemption 
The above mentioned are but a few ways in which the Niger Delta has been affected Most times 
structure erection of this oil companies can also have an effect on the environment During the 
construction of the NLNG Gas plant in Bonny foot prints of Hippopotami were found there 
These giant animals known to have flourished in the Finima Area which the NLNG plant now 
occupies In this case it is obvious that the activities of the company caused the wildlife to 
migrate due to the disturbances from the oil companies14 
This is a proof that oil exploration activities can either reduce biodiversity in an area or make 
them go totally extinct

EFFORTS TO CONSERVE THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE NIGER DELTA 
In all of these issues there have still been efforts to curb the negative impacts of oil exploration 
in the Niger Delta They are mostly in forma of laws and agencies and the first I will be 
highlighting is 
 THE OIL POLLUTION ACTS OF 1990 
This is responsible for many oil concerned improvements in the nation concerning oil spillage 
prevention mitigation clean up and liability The objective of this law was to reduce oil spillage 
it also ensures that the federal response system is adequately prepared to manage the impacts of 
oil spills that occur15 
 THE NESREA PROTECTION AGENCY 
This was formerly known as the 1988 Federal Environmental Protection Agency Act This Act is 
legally vested with the responsibility of protecting and sustaining the Nigerian environment 
through the formulation and implementation of regulatory frame works The environmental 
Impact Assessment Act Decree no 86 of 1992 requires an environmental impact assessment to 
be conducted “where the extent nature” or location of a proposed project or activity is such that 
it is likely to significantly affect the environment16 
 NATIONAL OIL SPILLAGE DETECTION AND RESPONSE AGENCY 
The Federal Executive Council of Nigeria has approved a national oil spill detection and 
response agency The establishment of this agency was in compliance with the International 
Convention on Oil Pollution preparedness response and cooperation to which Nigeria is a

signatory Efforts are also being made by this body to ensure the use of environmentally friendly 
drilling fluid and mud systems17 
 NONGOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES 
Nongovernmental agencies and the oil companies themselves have also contributed efforts to 
curb the destruction of biodiversity in the Niger Delta In November 1981 eleven oil companies 
operating in Niger Delta including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC 
formed the Clean Nigeria Association CAN to help prevent and control oil spills in the region 
Nongovernmental organizations such as Living Earth Nigeria Foundation Our Niger Delta and 
environmental Rights Action are working together to stop further destruction of the Niger 
Delta’s fragile ecosystem through embarking on public awareness and conservation projects in 
the area18 
CONCLUSION 
This study investigates the environmental pollution and their adverse effects on the host 
communities of oil exploration sites in the Niger Delta As it is an important issue that requires 
urgent and prompt attention although there are still laws and principles like the Oil Pollution Act 
of 1990 and the Polluter Pays Principle more ideas and work ought to be put in place for the 
success of the salvaging of the Niger Delta as the already existing laws are not thoroughly being 
yielded to by the companies involved It is also very important to take more actions as earlier 
stated to curb these pollution because the petroleum production presently forms the major natural 
based resources on which the country depends The policy makers within the oil exploration

companies ought to look into the matter on ground to also protect the health safety and welfare 
of these communities affected19 
RECOMMENDATION 
In my legal opinion I recommend that some of the health and safety measures given to the 
members or staff in such oil companies should be extended to the community members and the 
companies in turn should be able to adhere to relevant government legislation with the goal of 
protecting lives and properties in their areas of operation to prevent or abolish the present 
degradation caused by them This will in turn boost the country’s economy in all aspects as those 
in charge of the agricultural sector at the grass root which are these indigenes in the Niger Delta 
though not only them will be able to properly bounce back and continue life without much 
borders20
