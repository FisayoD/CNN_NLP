Abstract 
 
This is a literature review article The purpose of this article is to explain and provide a deeper 
understanding of economic and industrial espionage Furthermore it describes legal and 
illegal methods of espionage and highlights the different aspects of preventing espionage such 
as technical operational physical and personnel security A number of theoretical concepts 
have been extracted and analyzed from different scientific articles which have been 
summarized and anticipated in the form of theoretical framework Incredible results are often 
produced by exploiting industrial espionage By concentrating on complete security and not 
simply specialized security data security experts can altogether hamper enemy endeavors to 
take their associations data resources

1 Introduction 
 
One of the issues for the confrontations within the field of data security is the scarcity of 
tenable knowledge about existing threats to intelligence protection Governments and 
companies experience a deficiency of ascertainment and information gathering in this field 
and face an increasing problem of industrial espionage Thorleuchter  Van den Poel 2013 
Moreover  different researchers such as Malone Baluja Costanzo and Davis 2000 show 
the evidence that many of the recognized intrusions in the information systems are ignored 
which makes impossible to provide the proper statistical analysis However in many cases 
described by Polanyi 1967 theft of knowledge from the organization is not allowing robbers 
to use the technology and results in further violations such as luring away employees or even 
kidnapping   
 
Humanity knows a variety of industrial espionage examples as well as preventive methods 
through the history Thus Britain’s patent laws of the 1780s aimed to prevent stealing 
technologies in emerging textile industry Ferdinand  Simm 2007 During American Civil 
War as shown in Mendell 2011 work Mrs EH Baker was memorizing the firepower layout 
and technologies of Confederate States’ submarines and transmitted the information to the 
South States’ Navy Herring 1992 draws the great example of intelligence gathering which 
P a g e  2 | 8 
 
later helped to build one of the most powerful financial empires from North of Europe With 
the help of one of his employees the Swedish banker Marcus Wallenberg has managed to 
copy the idea of intelligence cooperation between the French government and local banks         
 
Data security experts center their endeavors on what they know best Technical security 
systems have a high level of impact on the intelligence protection Thus the most part of the 
budget for the protection from espionage is spent on Firewalls and Internet security software 
enabling the safety from hacker attacks However the attention focus on the protection from 
the external intrusion does not save organizations from threats from insiders which are 
responsible for more than 70 of thefts related to information systems Pitts 2008 
Moreover the focused hacker attack can dodge most of the electronic protective mechanisms 
which often demonstrates the waste of budget on inefficient software                 
 
From the above statements is clear that the information has different forms The task for the 
information security professionals is to assure the maximum protection in these forms 
operational technical physical security and prevention of personnel information outflow The 
weak gap in any of elements of the protection system will give the advantage for the industrial 
spies to sneak in and steal the data           
 
2 Literature Review

Economic and Industrial Espionage 
 
Different scholars give various definition and names to industrial espionage Wright and Roy 
1999 name it as corporate or economic espionage and industrial intelligence Søilen 2016 
distinguish economic and industrial espionage explaining that the last one is exempted from 
the involvement of the government in collecting information and stealing the knowledge Per 
se military use a version of economic espionage as warfare through the internet to destroy the 
core infrastructure of the enemy’s country Nasheri 2005 explains the strategic connections 
between government intelligence outfits and the success of taken nation The first shifts in 
industrial espionage methods started along with the existence of the information age and 
World Globalization The US Economic Espionage Act outlines the legal aspects of industrial 
espionage leaving open the discussion either to keep trade secrets or move forward the open 
global society           
 
The current literature explains the thread caused by the industrial spies According to I 
Winkler 1997 vulnerability aspects of the organization must be analyzed comprehensively 
in order to reduce risks from the various channels of information attacks from industrial spies  
Cornwall 1991 gives the emphasis on the explanation of methods and techniques for the 
practical approach of collecting intelligence from companies in a ‘civilized’ way On the 
contrary to Cornwall there are researchers including Rustmann 2002 who describe the 
industrial espionage as a cynical targetoriented business giving the bright examples of the 
nonethical CIA operations   
 
Penenberg and Barry 2008 give comprehensive details of the relations within spy 
organizations who provide the industrial spies for the governments The vulnerability of 
P a g e  3 | 8 
 
certain entrepreneurs plays an important role in the success of industrial espionage However 
Perman 2010 indicates the high importance of the professionalism of spies giving the 
example of the commercial success in technological startups after applying the espionage 
techniques of Israeli militarists Mendell 2011 drives the focus to the espionage attacks risk 
reducing describing practical ways of security operations Furthermore he develops and the 
idea of ‘internal intelligence’ for the surveillance and control of employees and activities 
within the company

Corporate Crime 
 
Corporations are valuable business units which have a high scope of the economic and 
political influence on the society Some cases of corporate criminal activities appear within 
the ‘whitecollar’ community and not always are of the economic nature According to  Pontell 
and Geis 2007 the positional power and the corporate culture are the main drivers for the 
whitecollar criminal behavior of individuals The main reasons for the criminal engagement 
of the individuals through the corporate mechanisms are apparent awareness or unawareness 
of the criminal activity results or the collective misinterpretation of the truth within the whole 
value chain activities   
 
Hence the statement above shows the evidence that behavioral habits in the organization may 
contribute to the choicemaking decisions towards corporate criminal activities Nasheri 
2005 p 7 gives two possible scenarios for the employees’ crime activities in a corporation 
in one case dissatisfaction of the job pushes people to use the information secrets of the 
company for their own benefits in another case external actor competitor or foreign nation 
misappropriates the trade secrets from organization or another nation Michalowski and 
Kramer 2006 describe the mechanisms of the corporate crime and argue that most 
capitalistic nations commit regulatory crime established by its elite as a less crime than a street 
robbery Having economic and political power these leaders can avoid the prosecution and 
reduce the risk of being convicted as crime acting individuals

Methods of Industrial Espionage 
 
There are materials in evidence of the actions of former Soviet agents for the industrial 
espionage as well as small groups of spy agencies hired by countries governments to create 
the thread in different nations’ economies Pasternak  Witkin 1996 In many cases the 
methods applied by these professional spies can break any protection in the companies’ 
intelligence system    
 
231 Legal Methods  
 
There are a few types of legal industrial espionage Competitors can buy products from the 
company as such get the prototype or a working technology to explore Buying a company 
is another legal method for acquiring the core technology This method is widely practiced in 
the Global World Economy and none of the management can create the protection and prevent 
capturing the information in this case House 1995  
P a g e  4 | 8 
 
In the case of the company’s willingness to enter the foreign market it is possible to use 
another method of acquiring legal information the company can be pressurized by the 
government or the partner of the foreign company to train the local workers and managers in 
the critical technology The corporate security managers are not always involved in a decision
making process of entering the market and the senior management decides if the ‘game is 
worth the candle’ House 1995  
 
Industrial competitors are often able to gather the valuable information through the open 
source information OSI The thorough review of the newspapers scientific articles annual 
reports patent filings marketing materials advertisements apps word of mouth etc can give 
a wealth of knowledge about the company and its products Very often the company could not 
realize the value of the information that is given away to the open source House 1995    
 
231 Illegal Methods  
 
In many cases the value of the desire to get the information pushes rivals to steal or copy it 
without permission Very often the insiders are used to access the company Traditionally 
moles or someone with the good contacts in the company and willing to coop with criminals 
These people often have the access to the necessary information or can provide the access for 
the spies in exchange for the money In some cases employees could be initiators for the 
information crime themselves offering the corporate secrets to the competitors for sale 
Pasternak  Witkin 1996        
While traveling on the business trip employees of the company can become a subject of 
sophisticated spy methods Special monitoring devices hidden cameras and bugs can collect 
the necessary details about the company Executives of the big US companies have reported 
commonly of search in their hotel rooms House 1995  
 
The methods of industrial espionage are limited only by the imagination of the spies 
However physical stealing of information is very effective and may give to robbers’ 
information which they would not collect in another way It could be made by breaking into 
buildings and offices connecting to the cables downloading the files on the flash drive or a 
disk Spies can also use the trashdiving to the garbage containers to gather the information 
Very often it gives more information to the rivals than the person who unconsciously throws 
the documents to the trash bin may think        
 
24   Ways of Avoiding Industrial Espionage 
 
The methods used in industrial espionage are similar to techniques of traditional spies This 
gives the guidance for the companies which want to prevent stealing the information from 
their archives House 1995 As for big corporations the potential loss of information counts 
in numbers of many figures the preventive methods must therefore supply the proper 
protection and extensive countermeasures These methods include physical technical 
operational and personnel security  
 
 
 
P a g e  5 | 8 
 
241 Technical Security  
 
The implementation of technical protection provides electronic systems security These 
countermeasures ensure the proper work of confidential standards of the company with 
integration into a computer network All these technical methods are well known and work 
successfully within the electronic systems of many organizations I S Winkler 1996    
 
242 Operational Security  
 
Operational security is based on the business model of the company or the value chain 
activities of the organization The strict procedures of the transition and control of the 
information must be supported by the clear understanding of the marketing processes research 
activities product development manufacturing and distribution The compromised 
information must be secured with additional control I S Winkler 1996 
 
243 Physical Security  
 
As mentioned above the threat of physical stealing of the information is a serious issue 
Hence the access to the company’s facilities and archives must be strictly controlled and 
regulated It can be ensured by the limitation of access for third parties such as clients or 
partners and the employees The organization should avoid the free access to corporate 
facilities especially the archives with the critical information If the company is big it is a 
good idea to require all the employees to wear the corporate badges with a status indication 
employee visitor partner etc This will avoid the awkward moments and the mock 
competence by violators Moreover the policy of the company should encourage people to 
check the badges of the individuals who they are not familiar with Not the last issue to name 
is control of the trash which comes out the office to avoid the outflow of the information 
through the garbage disposal system I S Winkler 1996       
 
244 Personnel Security 
 
All employees with the potential access to the important files should be carefully investigated 
for their background It is good to have an electronic system access to the facilities where 
everyone who enters the office uses an electronic ID to open doors or copy the data The 
company should support the intercommunication of administrative and human resources 
departments All unusual activities should be analyzed and investigated as soon as possible I 
S Winkler 1996

Cronin Ryan and Coughlan 2008 justify the research method and describes that Meta
amalgamation is the nonfactual procedure used to coordinate assess and translate the 
discoveries of different subjective research thinks about Such reviews might be consolidated 
to recognize their regular center components and topics Discoveries from phenomenological 
grounded hypothesis or ethnographic reviews might be incorporated and utilized Not at all 
like metaexamination where a definitive aim is to diminish discoveries meta blend includes 
dissecting and orchestrating key components in each review with the point of changing 
individual discoveries into new conceptualizations and understandings 
 
4 Discussion 
 
The discussion provided in the literature about industrial espionage shows the continuous 
alterations of the advantages from corporate crime The roles of different actors for value 
creation and capturing the value by stealing technologies can switch dynamically through the 
centuries Søilen 2016 The Global World can face bigger challenges of information security 
in the future unless the better agreements between governments and businesses are 
established Hence security managers have to be aware of the possible implications of the 
industrial espionage attacks against their organizations  
 
Ferdinand and Simm 2007 argue about the limits of the informational input to the 
organization from illegal sources and give the review of the external learning of the 
P a g e  7 | 8 
 
companies The threat is identified as a sign of upcoming crisis “the prodromal stage” Fink 
1986 pp 2122 In the context of this paper industrial espionage is a corporate crime and 
the task for security managers is in evaluating the threats and find the ways of protection from 
it I Winkler 1997 and Mendell 2011  
 
Finally Søilen 2016 argues that early selftaught industrialists voyaging were the standard 
method for learning Really learning by voyaging has been a very much utilized strategy for 
gaining an upper hand all through history In this manner we have completed the cycle with 
regards to modern undercover work inside a couple of hundreds of years and there is nothing 
to propose that these exchanging parts of who remain to benefit from spying and who remain 
to lose will stay static Rather we may expect that this will keep on changing with the rotations 
in the upper hand of countries unless a superior arrangement of global laws and assertions can 
be set up 
 
5 Conclusion 
 
Above all else supervisors must recognize that the risk of mechanical undercover work is in 
a consistent calculation of a contemporary business life There is no pointer of a decline in 
movement it is digging in for the long haul An inescapable outcome is that all exercises 
identifying with keeping modern spies from focusing on an association must be nonstop Also 
supervisors must understand their enemies are not straightforward patio analysts but rather 
exceedingly gifted proficient spies utilizing a similar reconnaissance strategy whether they 
work for an administration insight office or a business knowledge equip 
 
The current methods of the information security mainly focus on the technical aspects of the 
protection system Still with the development of the information technologies it is impossible 
to assure full protection from the external attacks of spies In addition the concentration of 
the budget and administrative efforts for security on the technical methods creates the gap in 
other methods of protection the data from thieves All the recent scientific articles provide the 
evidence of the high level of informational outflow with the help of insiders Hence the only 
comprehensive system of preventive methods for espionage threat with all the security 
disciplines included can maximize the protection of data
