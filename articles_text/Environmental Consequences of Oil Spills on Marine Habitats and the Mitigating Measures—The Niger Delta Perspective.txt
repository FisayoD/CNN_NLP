1 Introduction  
While most countries of the world faced natural hazards Nigeria is faced with numerous technological and or 
human induced hazards among which oil spills are leading with severe short and long term cumulative impacts on 
affected populace For instance European nation experienced 10 incidences of oil spills in 40 years while Nigeria 
experienced 9343 incidences in 10 years 1 2 Studies have also shown that the quantity of oil spilled in the Nigerian 
environment in five decades was at least 913million barrels equivalent to 50 Exxon Valdez oil spills of 1989 
260000 barrels 3 4 This positioned the region as one among five most ruthlessly petroleum damaged environment 
in the world 5 6 Consequently these disasters have affected the environment arable lands water resources and 
livelihood structures of the immediate oil producing communities of Nigeria 5 The impact further degenerates to 
increase in poverty crisis and unrest within the crude oil producing environment 7 Leading to formulations of 
different agitation groups in call for environmental justice and livelihood support mechanisms This paper stresses 
that oil spills have not just caused environmental ecological water and air pollution but have negative stark socio
economic breakdown which includes loss of job and restiveness through the nonpayment of monetary and 
infrastructural compensations to affected host and transit oil communities This calls for the need to investigate the 
socioeconomic impacts specifically as large number of studies have looked at the environmental and health impacts 
812 Importantly how the impact influence restiveness using statistical analytical tools for the analysis  
2 Literature Review 
21 Disasters and Disaster Impacts 
 
The term ‘Disaster’ has undergone a number of efforts at redefining with some more effective than others 
depending on the purpose and interest what individuals consider as a disaster the situation disciplines and context 
Quarantelli and Dynes 13 described disaster as an entrance into a state of uncertainty duplication of war catastrophe 
and an expression of social vulnerabilities Mohamed Shaluf 14 described disasters as an emergency occurring due 
to humaninduced or natural hazards that result in noteworthy changes in circumstances over a period However this 
definition doesn’t reflect the harshness of the incidents Parker and Handmer 15 define disaster as “unusual natural 
or manmade event including an event caused by failure of technological systems which temporarily crushes the 
response capacity of human communities groups of individuals or natural environment and which causes massive 
damage economic loss disruption injury and or loss of life” However United Nations International Strategy for 
Disaster Reduction 16 describe disaster “as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society 
involving widespread human material economic or environmental losses and impacts which exceeding the ability 
of the affected community or society to cope using its own resource” p9 This definition embodies the same as 
Parker and Handmer 15 emphasis on the economic and human ability to withstand the harshness of the effects From 
the definition above disaster can be defined as an unprevented incident that forcefully placed vulnerable people in 
the quest for external assistance and this study adopts the definition of the United Nations  
 
22 Disaster Impacts 
 
 The strictness of any incident is not the volume and magnitude but the effects 17 The most necessary factor in 
determining the seriousness of an incident such as oil spill is where the oil ends The extent of the effect weather 
condition socioeconomic characteristic of the location and the communities therein These in a way can be influenced 
by the ‘developed or developing’ nations and the response techniques cleanup measures adopted the effectiveness 
and the environmental benefit Hence both developed and developing nations suffers oil spill incidents 18 For 
example the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 affected thousands of sea birds fishes 
fishing industries and waterways with continuous impact on communities 19 20 On the contrary developing 
countries such as Angola and Nigeria are faced with similar and or worst scenarios of incidents of oil spills with 
degenerating impacts due to lack of management measures response strategies and policy enforcement Hence it’s 
evident that disaster can occur anywhere but frequently the poor and underdeveloped countries who suffers the most 
severe and longterm impacts For instance there are growing anxieties regarding threats on loss of biodiversity

deforestation and environmental pollution21 in the Nigerian context Different habitats have trailed their 
biodiversity at an unexpected proportion 2123 aquatic species and wildlife have been reported depleting and threat 
on plant species extinction 6 The impacts on the environment remains disheartening as the environment is a man’s 
first right and foundation for other rights 24 These also increase the concerns for environmental justices and 
pollution control campaign for drawing the world attention towards the reduction means of the degenerating impacts 
of oil spills on the societies Nwilo and Badejo 25 mentioned specifically on the degenerating situations of the 
Nigerian oilproducing environment with emphasis on mismanagement and lack of environmental regulation 
enforcement as a key drawback for proper environmental management systems Kadafa 5 further argued that oil spill 
impacts on the environment and ecosystem services have increased poverty rate and displacement of people 
physically mentally and job wise The arguments of Kadafa 5 and Nwilo and Badejo 25 demonstrate 
significantly how oil spill have impacted on the environment and the ecology with the degenerated negative impacts 
on the social aspect of the communities which cut across local economic growth and restiveness “These issues have 
received little attention so far”  
221 Social and Economic impacts of oil spill disaster 
Social impacts are the changes made by an organisation or company through their activities which affects the 
economic and wellbeing of the populace Hence Pegg and Zabbey 22 Fentiman and Zabbey 24 and Celestine 26 
in their different studies emphasise the severity of oil spills not just on the environment but also on culture traditions 
local economic norms values and ways of life among communities However Ebegbulem Ekpe 7 points that oil 
spillages in the unique Niger Delta states have caused extensive social underdevelopment which engrosses lack of 
social amenities physical infrastructure piped water schools hospitals and employment opportunities despite the 
huge benefit of the crude oil product with or without oil spills on the Nigerian national economy 7 The above 
argument demonstrates that instead of an increase in social and economic conditions through contributions from the 
endproduct of the crude oil  The reverse is the case as loss of sources of livelihood from the disaster has caused 
great unemployment Further Okonkwo 27 points that most social impacts of oil spill covers violence and 
frustrations reduction in tourism and hospitality industries Okonkwo’s points are similar to Gill Picou 28 who 
revealed how the British Petroleum BP oil spill and Exxon Valdez oil spill caused several social impacts threatening 
several ‘at risk’ including industries commercial and recreational fishing tourism and other enterprises tied to their 
natural resources The arguments draw the importance to establish that oil spill disaster directly and indirectly affects 
societies and communities in various dimensions 
212 Table Showing commonly faced impacts  
 
The table below highlights some impacts commonly faced as a results of petroleum production within affected 
Niger Delta communities These impacts on the environment have led to dissatisfaction on the communities hence 
leading to degradation of human development Chukwuemeka and Aghara 29 adds that the dissatisfaction of 
affected communities is on the level of damages to the ecology by several oil spills marginalisation and neglects 
regarding the development of the region However Chukwuemeka and Aghara 29 study did not employ any 
statistical and or content analytical tool for analysis Hence emphases the severity of the impacts

3 Study Methodology 
The study assesses oil spill impacts on livelihood structures and how it influenced restiveness within affected Niger 
Delta communities of Nigeria Qualitative research design is adopted using different techniques such as focus group 
discussion interviews documents and secondary data Eleven 11 key members of communities were purposively 
selected for an indepth interview discussion in their various communities Focus group discussion were conducted 
within the selected areas of the study The participants include youth leaders members of periwinkle company 
association chiefs members of community representatives and members of social activists group The rationale for 
selecting them was that these key people are indigenous and have lived all their lives within the communities The 
participants also possess the relevant experiences for the research question under investigation having lived and 
experienced different kinds of oil spills and operations of the oil and gas industries within the boundaries and shores 
of the region 
4 Table showing emerging themes 
The table below shows the themes as they emerged from participants’ frequent emphasis on the severity of the 
impacts of oil spills and its related waves on the communities Special emphasis was placed on the discussed themes 
from participants The researchers grouped these themes according to the frequencies from the raw data with the 
support of an NVivo software program to aid analysis of the data and discussions

4 Preliminary Research Findings 
The preliminary findings from the interviews and group discussions was analysed using thematic template 
techniques and with the aid of NVivo 11 software package The rationale for using a thematic template was that the 
researcher during the transcription of the raw data into word documents identified important sets of themes This helps 
to better organise the themes in a meaningful and useful way to aid the coding process Upon the outcome of the data 
from NVivo 11 programmed as shown in Figure 1 The theme community impacts were the most coded from the 
eleven participants and the focus group discussion This theme represents the overall impacts such as environment 
agriculture ecosystem health social and economic activities as it affects the communities Participants in both 
categories emphasised the fact that oil spills have deeply affected the entire community directly and indirectly Also 
lack of livelihood support and loss of jobs were identified as what constitutes the longterm effects of the disaster on 
the community

Fig 1 a Focus Group b Individual Interview 
Theme 1 Community Impacts  
Theme 1 examines the impacts of oil spills on selected communities affected by oil spill disaster to understand the 
degree of the impacts and how better it could be reduced This specific theme relates to agricultural land environment 
socioculture and socioeconomic aspect of the spill on the communities and how they have coped with the impacts 
The result from the top down and bottom up within the community context show significant impact on the entire 
structure The factors that also contributes to the high impact on the community as shown in figure 2 emerged during 
the coding process Hence economic and social impacts showed above 33 in both key individual interviewee and 
group discussions This shows that the socioeconomic conditions are highly affected by the incidents of oil spill with 
little attention as most studies have focused on environment and lands issues within 
Yes the spills have gravely impacted on the community’s such that there is loss of parental values due to the 
inabilities of full responsibilities for school children preschool children and the adolescents aged The rise of living 
cost and energy to transport to a very longdistance zone for fishing has contributed to the inabilities of parenting 
Communities are floundering in frustrations and neglect as the sources of water which are the most important aspect 
of life is contaminated and neglected for several years ‘we would have preferred to stay without the oil itself than 
‘having but not having’ we are slaves to our community society and environment’ Focus Group Discussion

Theme 2  Livelihood Support Structures 
Theme 2 explores community’s livelihood structures and support mechanisms from NGOs government and the oil 
multinational bodies The result from figure 1 shows above 21  13 on the coverage from participants which 
implies lower support structures from the concern bodies The participant emphases the fact that environment and 
sources of livelihood are forcefully detached from their culture and social wellbeing The lack of livelihood support 
has to some extent influenced restiveness and migration  
Lack of livelihood support has essentially contributed to youth restiveness cultism thief and social tension We 
are handicapped in the midst of plenty we live on ‘survival of the fittest theory’ which has contributed positively and 
negatively to the societal aspects This is because most people benefit while some others lost their lives or become 
disabling in course for struggle with little or no recognition We are left with no choice than agitations protest and 
bunkering for livelihood support The cassavas yam cocoyam plantations periwinkles bloodycoco species of fish 
which contributed more than 80 of our livelihood has been shortened and as such left us with no livelihood support 
alternative means Focus Group Discussion 
Theme 3 Jobs and Tourism  
Theme three considered how oil spills affects Jobs and tourism within the affected communities of the study The 
theme emerged as participants frequently mentioned their social activities which were partly influenced by the tourists 
through their local feasting swimming and fishing festivals Drawing upon the NVivo result in Fig1 the theme ‘Job 
and tourism’ where the least coded showing 12  10 However participants believed that despite out of fishing 
for several years the most impacts are on the water local economy and social aspects  
The rate of social tension is on the raise because people are handicapped rooming the streets and therefore 
increasing the risk of killings thief and kidnap The tourist that partly contributed to the increase of the local economy 
and social aspects of the society are forcefully driven away and thereby left the communities in stagnant economy 
Focus Group Discussion  
41 Theme 4 Influences on Restiveness  
Theme four explores how oil spills influenced restiveness within communities and how it relates to migration 
This theme is crucial as it sets to understand the factors that linked restiveness and migration within the oil spill 
context This will induce the importance to which measures be applied towards restiveness reduction Drawing from 
the software program NVivo 11 shows significant influence on community’s restiveness with key influential factors 
such as delays in cleanup double standard games divide and rule and frustration 
The People are physically mentally and emotionally frustrated and there are segregations enmity and lack of 
trust and transparency between communities and oil multinational cooperation within which has hugely influenced 
restiveness Also the divide and rule and double standard theory by the oil multinational cooperation where they 
engage youths and some compromised elders to protect them and their facilities by equipping them with weapons has 
contributed to restiveness Focus Group Discussion 
42 Theme 5 Wayout Standard strategy 
Theme five emerged as participants emphasised on the ‘wayout’ from various oil spill impacts having identified 
key effects on communities such as socioculture loss of jobs restiveness and socioeconomic impacts The construct 
under the theme if adopted is a substantial avenue for livelihood support and restiveness reduction measures There 
should be a monthly allowance for aged people within the oil transit and host affected communities Also 
infrastructural compensations such as centres for youth training and development good roads and good hospitals 
for healthcare services youth participations in decision making and community involvement in the oil exploration 
services These will practically curtail the impacts of the spill disasters on communities and its connected waves

Fig 3 Impacts Flow and Solution 
5 Discussion  
The study inferred that the information collected from the community representatives social activist members the 
periwinkle picking company associates members and the youth leaders will enable the oil and gas industries to 
improve or change their strategies The findings from the study show significant impacts of oil spills on the entire 
sources of community livelihood structure The finding is supported in the literature 7 The study illustrates that 
there is a defeat of parental values an increase of living cost due to damages to the environment waterways livelihood 
structures See Fig 2 loss of traditional learning lifestyles due to restive situations migration and socioeconomic 
format devastation 22 24 The identified effects on the communities have existed for decades hence the 
communities have coped with more agitations and protest as some ways of looking for standard mitigation strategy 
The oil spills to an extent have increased living standards of the communities and thereby instigating kidnap killings 
and social tension 
The study shows high level of impact on the community and influences on restiveness The various factors that 
contributed to restiveness where delays in cleanup neglect frustrations divide and rule policy none payment of 
compensations and lack of community participation in decision making 29 These problems were further investigated 
to find the solutions Hence it was discovered that infrastructure and monthly allowances for the aged population 
within affected transit and oil producing communities will reduce the numerous impacts on the communities The 
study discovered several specific observations such as the sudden increase of deformity in newborn babies and skin 
irritations However there is no empirical study to confirms the recent increase and deformity in newborn babies as 
observed during the data collection within communities of study which the study recommends   
6 Conclusion and Recommendations 
The emerging themes from this study are the researchers’ theoretical contributions in exploring the impacts of oil 
spills on communities and its influences on restiveness within affected communities of the Niger Delta The study 
concludes by stressing that oil spill impacts on communities are numerous and thereby needs the government and or 
the oil related companies to involve the community members in decision making Involving the community will give 
an insight to vital needs of the community which will be imbibed in the structure of the infrastructural compensation 
While this study was limited to a small sample within oil spill affected communities there are potentials that other 
none oil spill affected communities might be suffering the same issues The qualitative research design appears 
appropriate for researching oil spill impacts at the community and the study could be expanded into further research

by involving the oil multinationals and government agencies to draw their output towards a standard strategy for 
tackling oil spillrelated issues Studies should also be conducted to find the connection between oil spills blindness 
and deformities in new born babies within oil spill affected communities The study recommends that the stakeholders 
within oil related and the multinationals should improve their strategies and or contingency planning in tackling oil 
spillrelated issues and adhere to community’s plight appropriately
