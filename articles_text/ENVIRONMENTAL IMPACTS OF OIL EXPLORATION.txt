Abstract 
 
Nigeria has a coastline of approximately 853km facing the Atlantic Ocean This coastline 
lies between latitude 4o 10’ to 6o 20’ N and longitude 2o 45’ to 8o 35’ E The Nigerian coast 
is composed of four distinct geomorphology units namely the BarrierLagoon Complex 
the Mud Coast the Arcuate Niger Delta and the Strand Coast In 1956 Royal Dutch Shell 
discovered crude oil at Oloibiri a village in the Niger Delta and commercial production 
began in 1958 Today there are about 606 oil fields in the Niger Delta of which 360 are 
onshore and 246 offshore Nigeria is now the largest oil producer in Africa and the sixth 
largest in the world averaging 27 million barrels per day bbld in 2006 Nigerias 
proven oil reserved is 352 billion barrels Nigeria’s economy is heavily dependent on 
earnings from the oil sector which provides 20 of GDP 95 of foreign exchange 
earnings and about 65 of budgetary revenues Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in 
1956 the country has been suffering the negative environmental consequences of oil 
exploration and exploitation Between 1976 and 1996 a total of 4647 incidents resulted in 
the spill of approximately 2369470 barrels of oil into the environment In addition 
between 1997 and 2001 Nigeria also recorded a total number of 2097 oil spill incidents 
In 1998 40000 barrels of oil from Mobil platform off the Akwa Ibom coast were spilt into 
the environment causing severe damage to the coastal environment Several oil spill 
management policy and efforts are in place to reduce the menace of oil spill incidents in 
the country Some of these policies and efforts were made by the Federal Government Non 
governmental agencies and oil firms in the country The use of oil trajectory and fate 
models is also incorporated in oil spill management policy in the country We have 
developed a new oil spill trajectory model The results from a hypothetical simulation with 
the model from a point around OPL 250 located about 150km off the Nigerian coastline 
shows that the simulated oil spill for wet season reached the shore around Penington 
River after 104hours about 45 days Also during the dry season the results from the 
model indicate that the oil spill reached the shore at the entrance of Benin River after 
162hours 65days  
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Nigeria is bordered to the North by the Republics of Niger and Chad to the West by the 
Republic of Benin to the East by the Republic of Cameroon and to the South by the 
Atlantic Ocean Dublin Green et al 1999 Nigeria has a coastline of approximately 853km 
facing the Atlantic Ocean This coastline lies between latitude 4o 10’ to 6o 20’N and longitude 
2o 45’ to 8o 35’ E The terrestrial portion of this zone is about 28000 km2 in area while the 
surface area of the continental shelf is 46300km2 Figure 1 below is the Map of the Nigerian 
Coastal Areas 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 Climate of Nigeria’s Coastal Areas  
 
The coastal area is low lying with heights of not more than 30 m above sea level and is 
generally covered by fresh water swamp mangrove swamp lagoonal mashes tidal 
channels beach ridges and sand bars Dublin Green et al 1997 Nigeria’s total land and 
water area is 923768 sq km with the area of the land being 910768 sq km while that of 
water is 13000 sq km CIA World Fact Book 2005  
 
The Nigerian coastal zone experiences a tropical climate consisting of rainy season April 
to November and dry season December to March High temperatures and humidity as 
well as marked wet and dry seasons characterize the Nigerian climate The coastal areas 
have an annual rainfall ranging between 1 500 and 4000 mm Kuruk 2004  
 
The Nigerian coastal area experiences mainly the south westerlies which are onshore and 
confined generally to azimuths of 215o266o with velocities of 25ms During the rainy 
season wind speed increases to about 10ms especially during heavy rainfalls and 
thunderstorms 
 
Temperatures in the coastal areas are moderated by the cloud cover and by the generally 
damp air However mean monthly temperature vary between 24o C and 32o C throughout 
the year  
Figure 1 Map of Nigerian Coastal Areas 
 
The surface water of the Nigerian coast is basically warm with temperature generally 
greater than 24oC Sea surface temperatures show double peaked cycles which match 
quantitatively the cycle of solar heights Between October and May Sea surface 
temperatures range from 27o28oC while during the rainy season of June to October the 
range is between 24o and 25oC Dublin Green et al 1999 The surface water is typically 
oceanic surface water of the Gulf of Guinea with salinity generally less than 3500 
Dublin Green et al 1999 
 
12 Hydrology of Nigeria 
 
The hydrology of Nigeria is dominated by two great river systems the NigerBenue and 
the Chad systems With the exception of a few rivers that empty directly into the Atlantic 
Ocean all other flowing waters ultimately find their way into the Chad basin or down the 
lower Niger to the sea Kuruk 2004 
 
The inland water system includes thirteen lakes and reservoirs with a surface area of 
between 4000 hectares and 550000 hectares and has a total surface area of 853600 
hectares which represents about one percent of the total area of Nigeria They include 
lakes Chad Kainji Jebba Shiroro Goronyo Tiga Chalawa Gorge Dadin Kowa Kiri 
Bakolori Lower Anambra Zobe and Oyan With the exception of Lake Chad all the lakes 
are manmade Kuruk 2004 
 
The Lagos lagoon is one of several lagoon systems in the West African sub region and 
most extensive The lagoon is part of the barrier lagoon coasts of Nigeria The water is 
shallow and covers an area of about 208km2 Ekundayo and Akpata 1978 The lagoon is 
fed mainly by the rivers of Ogun Shasha Oshun Agboyi and Majidun the Ogudu creeks 
and waters of Epe and Lekki lagoons The Lagoon empties into the Atlantic Ocean via 
Lagos harbour The southern margin of the Lagos Lagoon is bounded by the Five Cowrie 
Creek the eastern margin by the Palavar Islands and its northern border by Ikorodu The 
lagoon is 40 – 64km long and has two arms one connects the Lekki Lagoon while the 
other leads northward into the hinterland Allen 1965 The lagoon is shallow with depths 
of 15 – 3m Ibe 1988 and made up of muddy and sandy bottom Its bottom relief is 
negligible  
 
Deltas and estuaries with their saline wetlands have a total surface area of 858000 
hectares while freshwaters cover about 3221500 hectares Other water bodies including 
small reservoirs fish ponds and miscellaneous wetlands suitable for rice cultivation cover 
about 4108000 hectares Kuruk 2004  
The entire Gulf of Guinea is highly stratified with a thin surface layer of warm fresh 
tropical water Longhurst 1964 The stratification of the upper water column along the 
Gulf of Guinea is generally very strong except in areas subject to upwelling events 
13 Geology of Nigeria’s Coast 
 
The Nigerian coastal geology is basically sedimentary and is dominated by the geology of 
arcuate Niger delta The Niger delta is composed of an overall classic sequence which reaches 
a maximum thickness of 912 kilometers lbe 1988 The Nigerian continental shelf is narrow 
 
in the west less than 30km but relatively broad off the Niger Delta and the eastern flank 
where it measures 4580 km in width The shelf is interrupted by several submarine canyons 
which include Avon Mahin and Calabar Canyons  
 
14 Geomorphological Units of Nigerian Coastal Areas 
 
The Nigerian coast in composed of four distinct geomorphological units namely the Barrier
Lagoon complex the Mud coast the Arcuate Niger delta and the Strand coast lbe 1988 
The geomorphology of the Lagos Lagoon is classified under the BarrierLagoon Complex 
which extends for about 250km from the NigerianBenin Republic border to Ajumo village 
The Complex consists of narrow beach ridges which are aligned parallel to the coast The 
beach sediments varied from medium to coarsegrained sand 
 
15 Vegetation of Nigeria’s Coastal Areas 
 
The vegetation of the Nigerian coastal area is characterised by mangrove forests brackish 
swamp forests and rain forests The country’s extensive mangrove ecosystem a great 
proportion of which lies within the Niger Delta and found mainly in the Rivers Delta 
Cross River Akwa lbom Lagos and Ondo states is estimated to cover between 500000 
and 885000 hectares Freshwaters start at the northern limit of the mangrove ecosystems 
and extend to the Sahelian region Kuruk 2004 
 
16 Oil Exploration and Exploitation 
 
In 1956 Shell British Petroleum now Royal Dutch Shell discovered crude oil at Oloibiri 
a village in the Niger Delta and commercial production began in 1958 Today there are 
606 oil fields in the Niger Delta of which 360 are onshore and 246 offshore Nigeria 
Country Analysis Brief 2005 Nigeria is now the largest oil producer in Africa and the 
sixth largest in the world averaging 27 million barrels per day bbld in 2006 Nigeria’s 
economy is heavily dependent on earnings from the oil sector which provides 20 of 
GDP 95 of foreign exchange earnings and about 65 of budgetary revenues CIA 
World Fact Book 2005 
Nigerias stateheld refineries Port Harcourt I and II Warri and Kaduna have a combined 
capacity of 438750 bbld but problems including sabotage fire poor management and 
lack of regular maintenance contribute to a low current capacity of around 214000 bbld 
according to World Markets Research Center Plans for several small independently
owned refineries are also being developed with the Nigerian government planning for 
three new refineries to come onstream by 2008 Nigeria Country Analysis Brief 2005 
161 Oil and Gas Reserves in Nigerian Coastal Areas 
 
Oil and Gas Journal 2005 estimates Nigerias proven oil reserved at 352 billion barrels 
The Nigerian government plans to expand its proven reserves to 40 billion barrels by 2010 
In February 2005 Nigeria announced the award of five oil blocks in the Joint Development 
Zone JDZ shared by Nigeria and neighboring Sao Tome and Principe STP The JDZ 
reportedly holds reserves of 11 billion barrels and could potentially yield up to 3 million 
bbld in the next 23 years Development is also occurring in the waters surrounding the 
 
JDZ Nigeria Country Analysis Brief 2005 Oil and Gas Journal 2005 further stated 
that Nigeria has an estimated 176 trillion cubic feet Tcf of proven natural gas reserves 
giving the country one of the top ten natural gas endowments in the world and the largest 
endowment in Africa  
 
162 Oil Spill Incidents in Nigeria 
 
Oil spill incidents have occurred in various parts and at different times along our coast 
Some major spills in the coastal zone are the GOCON’s Escravos spill in 1978 of about 
300000 barrels SPDC’s Forcados Terminal tank failure in 1978 of about 580000 barrels 
and Texaco Funiwa5 blow out in 1980 of about 400000 barrels Other oil spill incidents 
are those of the Abudu pipe line in 1982 of about 18818 barrels The Jesse Fire Incident 
which claimed about a thousand lives and the Idoho Oil Spill of January 1998 of about 
40000 barrels The most publicised of all oil spills in Nigeria occurred on January 17 1980 
when a total of 370 million litres of crude oil got spilled into the environment This spill 
occurred as a result of a blow out at Funiwa 5 offshore station Nigerias largest spill was an 
offshore wellblow out in January 1980 when an estimated 200000 barrels of oil 
84million US gallons spilled into the Atlantic Ocean from an oil industry facility and 
that damaged 340 hectares of mangrove Nwilo and Badejo 2005 
 
According to the Department of Petroleum Resources DPR between 1976 and 1996 a 
total of 4647 incidents resulted in the spill of approximately 2369470 barrels of oil into 
the environment Of this quantity an estimated 18204105 barrels 77 were lost to the 
environment A total of 549060 barrels of oil representing 2317 of the total oil spilt into 
the environment was recovered The heaviest recorded spill so far occurred in 1979 and 1980 
with a net volume of 69411713 barrels and 60051102 barrels respectively 
 
Available records for the period of 1976 to 1996 indicate that approximately 6 25 and 
69 respectively of total oil spilled in the Niger Delta area were in land swamp and 
offshore environments Also between 1997 and 2001 Nigeria recorded a total number of 
2097 oil spill incidents 
 
Thousands of barrels of oil have been spilt into the environment through our oil pipelines and 
tanks in the country This spillage is as a result of our lack of regular maintenance of the 
pipelines and storage tanks Some of these facilities have been in use for decades without 
replacement About 40000 barrels of oil spilled into the environment through the offshore 
pipeline in Idoho  
 
Sabotage is another major cause of oil spillage in the country Some of the citizens of this 
country in collaboration with people from other countries engage in oil bunkering They 
damage and destroy oil pipelines in their effort to steal oil from them SPDC claimed in 
1996 that sabotage accounted for more than 60 percent of all oil spilled at its facilities in 
Nigeria stating that the percentage has increased over the years both because the number 
of sabotage incidents has increased and because spills due to corrosion have decreased 
with programs to replace oil pipelines SPDC 1996  
 
Pirates are stealing Nigerias crude oil at a phenomenal rate funneling nearly 300000 
barrels per day from our oil and selling it illegally on the international trade market 
 
Nigeria lost about N77 billion in 2002 as a result of vandalisation of pipelines carrying 
petroleum products The amount according to the PPMC a subsidiary of NNPC 
represents the estimated value of the products lost in the process 
 
Illegal fuel siphoning as a result of the thriving black market for fuel products has 
increased the number of oil pipeline explosions in recent years In July 2000 a pipeline 
explosion outside the city of Warri caused the death of 250 people An explosion in Lagos 
in December 2000 killed at least 60 people The NNPC reported 800 cases of pipeline 
vandalization from January through October 2000 In January 2001 Nigeria lost about 4 
billion in oil revenues in 2000 due to the activities of vandals on our oil installations The 
government estimates that as much as 300000 bbld of Nigerian crude is illegally 
bunkered freighted out of the country 
 
In Nigeria fifty percent 50 of oil spills is due to corrosion twenty eight percent 28 to 
sabotage and twenty one percent 21 to oil production operations One percent 1 of oil 
spills is due to engineering drills inability to effectively control oil wells failure of machines 
and inadequate care in loading and unloading oil vessels 
 
2 IMPACTS OF OIL SPILL INCIDENTS ON NIGERIAN COASTAL 
AREAS 
 
Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in the 1950s the country has been suffering the 
negative environmental consequences of oil development The growth of the countrys oil 
industry combined with a population explosion and a lack of enforcement of 
environmental regulations has led to substantial damage to Nigerias environment 
especially in the Niger Delta region 
 
When there is an oil spill on water spreading immediately takes place The gaseous and 
liquid components evaporate Some get dissolved in water and even oxidize and yet some 
undergo bacterial changes and eventually sink to the bottom by gravitational action The 
soil is then contaminated with a gross effect upon the terrestrial life As the evaporation of 
the volatile lower molecular weight components affect aerial life so the dissolution of the 
less volatile components with the resulting emulsified water affects aquatic life Akpofure 
et al 2000 
 
The harmful effects of oil spill on the environment are many Oil kills plants and animals in 
the estuarine zone Oil settles on beaches and kills organisms that live there It also settles on 
ocean floor and kills benthic bottomdwelling organisms such as crabs Oil poisons algae 
disrupts major food chains and decreases the yield of edible crustaceans It also coats birds 
impairing their flight or reducing the insulative property of their feathers thus making the 
birds more vulnerable to cold Oil endangers fish hatcheries in coastal waters and as well 
contaminates the flesh of commercially valuable fish  
 
In the Nigerian coastal environment a large areas of the mangrove ecosystem have been 
destroyed The mangrove was once a source of both fuel wood for the indigenous people 
and a habitat for the areas biodiversity but is now unable to survive the oil toxicity of its 
habitat 
 
 
Oil spills in the Niger Delta have been a regular occurrence and the resultant degradation 
of the surrounding environment has caused significant tension between the people living in 
the region and the multinational oil companies operating there It is only in the past decade 
that environmental groups the Federal Government and the foreign oil companies 
operating in the Niger Delta began to take steps to mitigate the impacts Large areas of the 
mangrove ecosystem have also been destroyed The mangrove forest was in the past a 
major source of wood for the indigenous people In some places it is no longer in a healthy 
state to sustain this use Nwilo Badejo 2005  
 
The Idoho oil spill traveled all the way from Akwa Ibom state to Lagos state dispersing oil 
through the coastal states up to the Lagos coast This culminated in the presence of sheen of 
oil on the coastal areas of Cross river state Akwa Ibom state Rivers state Bayelsa state 
Delta state Ondo state and Lagos state  
 
In many villages near oil installations even when there has been no recent spill an oily 
sheen can be seen on the water which in fresh water areas is usually the same water that 
the people living there use for drinking and washing In April 1997 samples taken from 
water used for drinking and washing by local villagers were analyzed in the US A sample 
from Luawii in Ogoni where there had been no oil production for four years had 18 ppm 
of hydrocarbons in the water 360 times the level allowed in drinking water in the 
European Union EU A sample from Ukpeleide Ikwerre contained 34 ppm 680 times 
the EU standard  
 
Following the major Texaco spill of 1980 it was reported that 180 people died in one 
community as a result of the pollution On several occasions people interviewed by 
Human Rights Watch said that spills in their area had made people sick who drank the 
water especially children  
 
3 MANAGEMENT OF OIL SPILL IN NIGERIA 
 
Several laws and policies have been taken in managing oil spill incidents at the 
international and national levels These laws and policies are given in the following 
sections  
 
31 Oil Pollution Act OPA of 1990 
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 1990 is responsible for many of the nations 
improvements in oil spill prevention and response OPA 1990 provides guidance for 
government and industry on oil spill prevention mitigation cleanup and liability The 
majority of OPA 1990 provisions were targeted at reducing the number of spills followed 
by reducing the quantity of oil spilled OPA 1990 also created a comprehensive scheme to 
ensure that sufficient financial resources are available to clean up a spill and to compensate 
persons damaged by a spill It also ensures that the federal response system is adequately 
prepared to manage the impacts of oil spills that do occur and mandates that industry 
implement prevention and preparedness measures The OPA also mandates that tankers 
and inland oil facilities develop individual response plans Furthermore the OPA also 
mandates enhancements to the national response system and development of Area 
Contingency Plans  
 
32 National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency NOSDRA 
 
A National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency NOSDRA has been approved by 
the Federal Executive Council of Nigeria The Ministry of Environment which initiated 
the Agency has also forwarded to the Federal Executive Council for approval the 
reviewed draft National Oil Spill Contingency Plan NOSCP which the Agency would 
manage Alexandra Gas and Oil Connections 2006  
 
The establishment of the contingency plan and the agency was in compliance with the 
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Cooperation 
OPRC90 to which Nigeria is a signatory The draft bill on the NOSDRA has been 
forwarded to the National Assembly for deliberation and enactment into law Alexandra 
Gas and Oil Connections 2006  
 
Apart from intensifying efforts towards compliance monitoring and enforcement of oil and 
gas regulations and standards the ministry is also mounting pressure on the oil and gas 
operators for a gas flareout Effort is also being made according to the sources to ensure 
the use of environmentalfriendly drilling fluid and mud systems Alexandra Gas and Oil 
Connections 2006  
 
33 The Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC 
 
To reduce the rate of oil incidents along the Nigerian Coast particularly as a result of 
vandalisation the Federal Government through an act of the National Assembly in 2000 
passed into law the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC The Act among other 
things established a Commission to carry out among other things the following tasks  
a Cause the NigerDelta area to be surveyed in order to ascertain measures which are 
necessary to promote its physical and socioeconomic development  
b Prepare plans and schemes designed to promote the physical development of the Niger
Delta area  
c Identify factors inhibiting the development of the NigerDelta and assist the member 
states in the formation and implementation of policies to ensure sound and efficient 
management of the resources of the NigerDelta  
d Assess and report on any project funded or carried out in the NigerDelta area by oil 
and gas producing companies and any other company including nongovernmental 
organisations and ensure that funds released for such projects are properly utilised  
e Tackle ecological and environmental problems that arise from the exploration of oil in 
the NigerDelta area  
f Liaise with the various oil mineral and gas prospecting and producing companies on all 
matters of pollution prevention and control  
 
Essentially items e and f deal with issues pertaining to oil exploration and production 
and the NNDC act is a strategic way of dealing with all forms of pollution from these 
activities in the Niger Delta 
 
 
34 Petroleum Related Laws and Regulations 
 
Part of the means of managing the environment is to have in place the necessary laws 
regulations and guidelines According to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency 
Lagos Nigeria the following relevant national laws and international agreements are in 
effect  
a 
Endangered Species Decree Cap 108 LFN 1990 
b 
Federal Environmental protection Agency Act Cap 131 LFN 1990 
c 
Harmful Waste Cap 165 LFN 1990 
d 
Petroleum Drilling and Production Regulations 1969 
e 
Mineral Oil Safety Regulations 1963 
f 
International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for 
Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 
g 
Convention on the Prevention of Marine pollution Damage 1972 
h 
African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources1968 
i 
International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for the 
Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 
 
35 The Environmental Impact Assessment EIA decree No 86 of 1992 
 
The Environmental Impact Assessment EIA decree No 86 of 1992 was promulgated to 
protect and sustain our ecosystem The law makes the development of an EIA compulsory 
for any major project that may have adverse effects on the environment Ntukekpo 1996 
Olagoke 1996 It sought to assess the likely or potential environmental impacts of 
proposed activities including their direct or indirect cumulative short term and long term 
effects and to identify the measures available to mitigate adverse environmental impacts 
of proposed activities and assessment of those measuresOzekhome 2001 The carrying 
out of EIAs is policed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and by state 
environmental protection agencies  
 
36 Federal and State Agencies 
A number of Federal and State agencies deal with the problems of oil spill in Nigeria The 
agencies include the Department of Petroleum Resources DPR the Federal Ministry of 
Environment the State Ministries of Environment and the National Maritime Authority  
 
37 Efforts of the Oil Companies and Non Governmental Agencies 
 
Due to increasing awareness in preventing and controlling spills in Nigeria the Clean 
Nigeria Associates CNA was formed in November 1981 The CNA is a consortium of 
eleven oil companies operating in Nigeria including Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation NNPC The primary purpose of establishing the CNA is to maintain a 
capability to combat spills of liquid hydrocarbons or pollutants in general Nwilo  Badejo 
2005 
 
As a result of the focus on Shell’s activities in Nigeria Shell in collaboration with all the 
members of Oil Producers Trade Section OPTS of the Lagos Chambers of Commerce 
established the Niger Delta Environmental Survey NDES Shell the OPTS and the 
 
Rivers and Delta States governments provided the necessary funding for the activities of 
NDES 
 
The NDES was expected to provide  
a A comprehensive description of the area ecological zones boundaries and different 
uses of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources  
b An integrated view on the state of the environment and its relationship to local people  
c An analysis of the causal relationships between land use settlement patterns industry 
and the environment to provide a base line for future development planning  
d An indicative plan for the development and management of the Niger Delta NDES 
1996  
 
38 Oil Trajectory and Fate Models for Oil Spill Disaster Monitoring 
 
Oil spill simulation model is used in oil response and contingency planning and as a tool in oil 
fate and impact assessment Rossouw 1998 In the event of an oil spill taking place 
predictions of the slick can be supplied provided that the necessary meteorological 
information is available Rossouw 1998 Oil spillage can also be treated or removed by 
natural means mechanical systems absorbents burning gelling sinking and dispersion Oil 
spillage can be removed by natural means through the process of evaporation photochemical 
oxidation and dispersions WardleySmith 1977 Bioremediation can also be used for 
managing oil spill problems Hoff 1993 Prince 1993 Atlas 1995  
 
39 Nigerian Sat 1 
 
The Nigerian Sat 1 Satellite has joined the Disaster Monitoring Constellation an 
international earlywarning satellite network transmitting realtime information about 
droughts earthquakes deforestation and manmade disasters observable from space The 
Nigeria Sat1 an Orbit Satellite for geographical mapping would also help to check the 
perennial problem of oil pipeline vandalisation and assist in combating and managing oil 
spill incidents The Nigeria Sat1 would help in monitoring oil spill by providing the spill 
position which would serve as input data into the oil spill model It would also give the 
extent of coastal water and coastal areas polluted These information are vital for quick 
clean up of oil impacted areas 
 
310 International Cooperation 
 
To shore up the fight against oil smugglers in Nigeria the US has donated three 56 metre 
180ft refitted World War twoera patrol oats to the navy United Nations has also said 
that United States would donate additional four vessels The Pentagon is funding each 
boat’s refurbishment to the tune of 35m The efforts of the Federal Government with the 
assistance of the US are already yielding fruits The Nigerian Navy has intercepted several 
tankers  
 
311 Geographic Information System for Managing Oil Spill Incidents  
 
A successful combating operation to a marine oil spill is dependent on a rapid response 
from the time the oil spill is reported until it has been fully combated In order to reduce 
 
the response time and improve the decisionmaking process application of Geographic 
Information Systems GIS as an operational tool is very essential Information on the 
exact position and size of the oil spill can be plotted on maps in a GIS environment GIS 
offers opportunities for integration of oil drift forecast models prediction of wind and 
current influence on the oil spill in the computer program framework Milaka1995 
 
Required information for oil spill sensitivity mapping can be depicted on a set of thematic 
maps using GIS even though they can in theory be depicted onto a single sheet With the 
use of a GIS all the relevant information or themes can be stored in the system and 
produced onto maps in a format that befits the needs of the day Alternatively modelling 
exercises using the GIS can be conducted to assess the adequacy of any given oil spill 
contingency plan Parthiphan 1994  
 
The creation of regional spill response centres along coastlines will help in managing oil spill 
problems Smith and Loza 1994 The centres will use oil spill models for combating oil spill 
problems Using data collected with an airborne system to input one or several new starting 
points into the model will improve the accuracy of the further predictions Sandberg 1996  
 
312 Environmental Sensitive Index ESI Mapping 
 
ESI maps are basemaps that show the sensitivity of given locations or areas to a particular 
stress factor such as exposure to petroleum products on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being most 
sensitive The maps may contain physical and geomorphic features eg shorelines 
biological features and socioeconomic features such as agricultural fields Some ESI maps 
contain features of particular interest to oil spill planning and response such as the 
recommended positions of booms or skimmers The sensitivity of a given feature to a 
stress factor may be indicated by the color given the symbol or pattern used to represent it  
 
Standards for the development of the environmental sensitivity index maps for the coast of 
Nigeria have been developed by the Environmental Systems Research Institute ESRI 
These standards are used by all the oil companies to prepare ESI maps for their areas of 
operations in Nigeria  
 
313 Creating of Awareness 
 
Awareness creation on the impacts of oil spill is an integral part of management 
programme for oil spill along the coast of Nigeria This is being carried out by government 
at different levels and agencies such as the Niger Delta Development Commission 
NDDC  
 
4 SIMULATION OF OIL SPILL ALONG THE NIGERIAN COAST 
 
We have developed a new oil spill trajectory model The results from a hypothetical 
simulation with the model from a point around OPL 250 located about 150km off the 
Nigerian coastline shows that the simulated oil spill for wet season reached the shore 
around Penington River after 104hours about 45 days Also during the dry season the 
results from the model indicate that the oil spill reached the shore at the entrance of Benin 
River after 162hours 65days Figures 2 and 3 below show the oil spill trajectories for 
 
the wet and dry seasons respectively It is obvious from the figures below that the season 
of occurrence of an oil spill is a major in determining the oil spill trajectory for an area 
The wet season trajectory went eastwest wise while the dry season trajectory went 
northwards Areas to be affected by an oil spill to a reasonable extent depend on the period 
of the oil spill

5 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
51 Conclusion 
 
Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in the 1956 the country has been suffering the 
negative environmental consequences of oil development Sabotage has been a major cause 
of oil spillage in the country Oil spill incidents have destroyed the coastal vegetation 
polluted drinkable water and led to ethnic and regional crises in the Niger Delta Several 
oil spill management policy and efforts are in place to reduce the menace of oil spill 
incidents in the country Some of these policies and efforts include 
a 
The formation of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency NOSDRA by 
the Federal Executive Council of Nigeria  
b 
The putting in place of relevant acts and regulations on oil spill pollution 
c 
The passing into law of the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC 
d 
The establishment of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey 
e 
The incorporating oil trajectory and fate models into oil spill management policy in the 
country 
f 
The development of standards for the development of the environmental sensitivity 
index maps for the coast of Nigeria 
 
All these efforts have assisted in detection and management of oil spills along the Nigerian 
coast 
 
Results from a hypothetical simulation with the model from a point around OPL 250 
located about 150km off the Nigerian coastline shows that the simulated oil spill for wet 
season reached the shore around Penington River after 104hours about 45 days Also 
Figure 3 Oil Spill Trajectory for Dry Season on Nigerian Coastal Waters 
 
 
during the dry season the results from the model indicate that the oil spill reached the shore 
at the entrance of Benin River after 162hours 65days 
 
52 Recommendations 
 
The Nigeria Sat1 would help in monitoring oil spill by providing the spill position which 
would serve as input data into the oil spill model It would also give the extent of coastal 
water and coastal areas polluted These information are vital for quick clean up of oil 
impacted areas 
 
In order to reduce the response time and qualify the decisionmaking process application 
of Geographic Information Systems GIS as an operational tool has been suggested 
Information on the exact position and size of the oil spill can be plotted on maps in GIS 
and a priority of the combat efforts and means according to the identified coastal sensitive 
areas can be carried out 
 
The creation of regional spill response centres along coastlines would help in managing oil 
spill problems The centres will use oil spill models for combating oil spill problems Data 
collected with an airborne system could serve as inputs in the model  
 
The petroleum industry should work closely with government agencies universities and 
research centers to combat the menace of oil spill incidents 
 
More funds should be provided by all the stakeholders in the oil industry for further 
research in the development and use of oil spill models in the country The adoption of the 
model developed in this research work and the procurement of other oil spill models would 
serve as a basis in carrying out more research in this area 
 
The creation of NDDC by the Federal Government would go a long way in reducing the 
tension in the oil rich communities However the Federal Government State Governments 
and other nongovernmental agencies should ensure that the social amenities and needed 
infrastructures are provided for the oil rich communities
