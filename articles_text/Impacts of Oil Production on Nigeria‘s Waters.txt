ABSTRACT 
 
One of the major environmental problems in Nigeria today is that of oil pollution in the oil 
producing areas of the country The country has suffered environmental degradation as a result 
of the oil pollution in the last of five 5 decades The causes of this oil pollution were oil 
spillage gas flaring and effluent discharge from the refineries These have caused untold 
hardships on the people living close or near the oil installations or facilities and have affected 
their lives wellbeing means of livelihood and the environment generally Oil pollution 
activities have also affected their right to good and decent life human dignity and lots 
Unfortunately the victims seem to be unable to assert their human right The reason being that 
there are no constitutional and statutory provisions on environmental right to those who suffer 
such except common law remedies such as negligence nuisance etc which require strict and 
technical proofs The constitutional provision on the right to environment in chapter II of the 
1999 constitution is lax and not justifiable The only available redress is recourse to the human 
rights in Nigeria isa recourse to chapter 4 of the Constitution This situation has caused untold 
hardship on the people because they have no way of seeking redress when their rights are being 
violated As a result of this ugly development this work has recommended that Nigeria should 
borrow a leaf from other jurisdictions such as India South Africa etc where human rights and 
environmental rights are practiced together

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Pollution can be defined as the addition to the natural environment of substances or 
energy eg heat or sand at a rate that result in higher than natural concentration of the 
substance and therefore causes an adverse effect Hilson 2003 It is also the introduction by 
man into the environment of substances or energy liable to cause hazard to human health harm 
to living resources and ecological system damage to structure or human amenities with 
legitimate use of the environment Holdgate 1980 Activities in the oil and gas industry in 
Nigeria have caused a lot of environmental damage to human and plants The impact of 
pollution on the environment rights from when oil was discovered in Nigeria is farover 
reaching as it affects the delicate balance which exists in the interaction of the various key 
factors at play in the environment Akahalu 2014 AdogaIkong  Inyang 2017 AdogaIkong

2019 Thus the increase in human and industrial activities including oil and gas activities has 
increased the chances of pollution elements in the environment Pollution therefore affects the 
land water and air of the people of Niger Delta as a result of these activities  
This work seeks to examine the cause of oil pollution impact on the people which 
affects the human rights of the victims This work makes comparative analysis of other 
jurisdictions where environmental rights are protected 
 
CAUSES OF OIL POLLUTION IN NIGERIA  
 
a 
Oil spillage 
 
This is one of the ways in which the activities in the oil industry could contribute to 
pollution of the environment Oil spillage or oil spill is a situation whereby the liquid petroleum 
hydrocarbon is released into the environment as a result of human activity Oil spillage is 
categorized into four 4 groups minor medium major and disaster Chinedu  Chukwuemeka 
2018 The minor spill takes place when the oil discharge is less than 25 barrels in land waters 
or less than 250 barrels on offshore and coastal waters For the medium spill it must be 250 
barrels or less in the land or 2502500 barrels offshore and coastal waters Disaster refers to 
any uncontrolled well blow out pipeline rupture or storage tank failure Oil spillage may occur 
by accidents equipment failure lack of maintenance blow out sabotage etc natural disaster 
collisions and human errors in transportation Kadafa et al 2012 
 
b 
Gas flaring 
 
This is as a result of the burning of the unwanted natural gas released during production 
Udok  Akpan 2017 In other words it is the controlled burning of natural gas trapped within 
the place of oil reserves in the ground In Nigeria this is an intentional act by the oil 
multinational companies in order to save costs Udok  Akpan 2017 The pollution associated 
with these flares can affect man and his environment Gas flaring on a large scale is an 
extremely wasteful and environmentally harmful practice which is a contributor of greenhouse 
gas Hassan 2020 Gas flaring has caused a lot of environmental hazard to life property and the 
land of the oil producing areas of Nigeria Gas flaring releases huge quantity of methane which 
is capable of high global warming Gas flaring has a potentiality of harmful effects on the health 
and livelihood of the communities in vicinity This is because it releases a variety of poisonous 
chemicals which may include nitrogen sulfide and carcinogens such as benzapurene and dioxin 
It is a known fact that when humans are exposed to such substances they can suffer from a 
variety of ailments Those chemicals can aggravate asthma cause breathing difficulties and pain 
as well as chronic bronchitis Cipolla et al 2018 
A study carried out by climate justice estimates that exposure to banezene can be 
responsible for eight new cases of cancer in Bayelsa state alone Omagu 2012 Gas flares are 
often located close to local communities In Rumuola a community in Port Harcourt capital of 
Rivers State for instance a shell company flare is situated about 30 metres away from the 
nearest dwelling house Due to non adequate protection such as fencing around the place 
inhabitants of the villages around may run the risk of their lives working near the place as a 
result of the heat Udok  Akpan 2017 Gas flaring causes acid rain which affects the skin and 
hair of humans and animals It corrodes cars and roofs and raises body temperature beyond the 
limit that the heart can sustain for longevity It leads to blur vision foul smells ozone layer 
depletion draught and desertification

In the 1970s government recognized the potential of the natural gas industry thus 
enacted legislation banning gas flaring in Nigeria According to the legislation Associated Gas 
Reinjection Act 1979 all companies were mandated to submit gas utilization preliminary 
programmes by 1st of April 1980 and furthermore detailed programmes on utilization or 
reinjection by 1st January 1980 Eweje 2006 No company was to flare gas after 1st January 
1984 without the authorization and permission of the Minister The punishment of non
compliance which is a forfeiture of concession Eweje 2006 
The deadline was shifted a couple of times to April 1984 and to January 1985 After 
this instead the Association Gas Reinjection Continuing flaring of gas regulation 1984 came 
into force and provided for exemptions to the general ban of flaring As a result of this the 
ministry had to exempt 55 out of 84 shell’s fields 10 out of mobil’s 15 field 4 out of Agips 22 
7 out of Gulf’s 17 3 out of Texeco’s 5 4 out of ELF’s 6 1 out of Ashland’s 3 and 1 each for 
Tonneco and Pan Ocean Omorogbe 2009 A total of 86 out of 155 fields thereby remained 
exempted from the antiflaring provisions The remaining fields were subject to fairly 
insignificant penalties which made it far more economical for the companies to flare than to 
utilize or reinject Omorogbe 2009  
It must be noted here that the above provision did not in any way ban gas flaring in 
Nigeria absolutely hence neither the government nor the oil companies are desirous of bringing 
gas flaring to an end The reason being that the flareout target date was shifted severally from 
1984 to 2004 an then to 1st January 2008 The government of Nigeria also informed  the United 
Nations in November 2003 that it come out with a deadline for all oil and gas companies to stop 
flaring by the year 2021 Fagbohun 2010 Many Nigerians do not see the flare out targets and 
deadline realistic because uptill today gas flaring has not been stopped despite the gas master 
plan to utilize and conserve gas in Nigeria 
 
c 
Effluent Discharge 
 
This has to do with the release of liquid waste or sewage into a river or the sea It is also 
an overflowing of water or gas from a natural body of waste or from manmade activities 
Refinery wastes have characteristics which constitute the main potential for pollutants For 
instance the constant discharge of waste and untreated substances into land creeks rivers and 
see causing pollution These aqueous refinery effluents generally contain a variety of organic 
and inorganic pollutants such as oxide of nitrogen carbon sulphur drilling fluid and mud 
which kill living resources 
The effect of effluent discharge mainly has to do with healthrelated disease The high 
oil and greases concentration observed in effluent recurring water bodies can be responsible for 
the depletion of fish and other aquatic life Agrios 1997 As a result of increase in petroleum 
activities in Nigeria effluent are discharged with little regard to the aquatic environment and the 
contents of effluents have serious toxicological effects on aquatic environment and humans 
Agrios 1997 Refining effluents containing oil when discharged into water bodies cause 
depletion of dissolved oxygen due to transformation of organic components into inorganic 
compounds loss of biodiversity through a decrease in amphipod populations that are important 
in the food chain and enthrophication 
 
IMPACT OF OIL POLLUTION ON THE ENVIRONMENT  
 
 
Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria the country has suffered negative environmental 
consequences of the exploitation Aigbedion  Iyayi 2007 Oil pollution either oil spillage gas 
flaring or effluent discharge has its impact on the Nigerian environment in many ways Oil

spillage for instance destroys vegetation rendering farmlands barren and unproductive Oil 
spillage can also damage agriculture land and affect soil fertility Oil is capable of killing plant 
and animals and can settle on beaches and kill organism thatlive there like fish Nigeria has 
suffered the consequences of the destruction of its mangrove ecosystem as a result of oil 
spillage Instances are as follows One the overflow of the waste pit at Benibay Escravas 
which destroys the environment the vegetation at Ogharefe was destroyed as a result of oil 
spillage Amadi  Abdullah 2012 The Idoho oil spill extended from Akwa Ibom state to 
Lagos state dispersing oil through the coastal states up to Lagos coast This culminated in the 
presence of spilled oil along the coastal areas of Cross Rivers State AkwaIbom State River 
State Bayelsa Delta State Ondo State and Lagos State Kadafa 2012 
 
It is a fact that in many villages near oil installations even after a long time spills an 
oily sheen can still be seen on the water this usually in fresh water communities is the same 
water that the people living there use for drinking and domestic use In April 1997 for instance 
samples taken from water used for drinking and washing by local villagers in Luawil in 
Ogoniland where there had been no oil production for four years were analyzed in the USA 
and thus had 18 ppm of hydrocarbons in the water 350 times the level allowed in drinking 
water in the European Union EU Again a sample from Ukpaleide Ikwere contained 34ppm 
680 times the EU standard Nrior  Jirigwa 2017 Following the major Texaco spill of 1980 
the report indicated that 180 people lost their lives in one community as a result of the pollution 
On several occasions people interviewed by human rights watch said that spills in their areas 
made those who drink the water sick especially children Nrior  Jirigwa 2017 
 
Gas flares cause acid rain which affects the skin and hair of humans and animals 
corrodes roofs and cars and raises body temperature beyond limits that the hearts can sustain 
The quality of air inhaled by the people in the immediate vicinity is greatly reduced by the 
introduction of excessive smoke suspended particles and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere 
In IfieIkoporo an Itsekiri community near Warri gas flaring inflicts the natives with heat 
rashes and damages their farms In EbochaEgbema the people complained of serious health 
problems and environment issues caused by gas flaring Huge flares accumulates in the air and 
above them black clouds leap into the sky The air around them is usually hot and has a smell 
due to the gas flare Water in this area is also as black as charcoal and the effects and hardship is 
meted on them thus depriving them of their right to life and healthy environment Obiechina  
Rimande 2018 In Bodo West in Bonny Local Government Area an increase artisanal refining 
between 2007 and 2011 has been accompanied by a 10 percent loss of healthy mangrove cover 
or 397381m2 If this is left unchecked may lead to irreversible loss of mangrove habitat in this 
area Obiechina  Rimande 2018

The issue of human rights of the victims of oil pollution in the oil producing areas  
1 Human rights under the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as 
amended – section 33 of the constitution provides for right to life and it states in 
section 331 that 
Every person has a right to life and no one shall be deprived internationally 
of his life save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a 
criminal offence which he has been found guilty in Nigeria 
Also Section 34 of the constitution provides for the right to human dignity and it states 341 – 
every individualsis entitled to respect for the dignity of his person and accordingly 
a No person shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment

2 Human right provision under the International Covenant on Economic Social and 
Cultural Right 1966 enjoys state parties to recognize the right of everyone to an 
adequate standard of living for himself and his family… 
3 Universal Declaration of Human Right under Article 25 provides that everyone has the 
right to a standard of living adequate for health and wellbeing of himself and his family 
Loveless  Holman 2006 
4 African Charter on Human and People’s Right – Articles 4 16 and 24 of the charter 
provides for human right Article 4 provides – human beings are inviolable Every 
human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and integrity of his person No one 
may be arbitrarily deprived of this right Article 16Every individual shall have the right 
to enjoy the best attainable and satisfactory condition… Article 24 – All people shall 
have the right to a general satisfactory environment favourable to their development 
Despite the above provisions that confer human right on every person in Nigeria 
especially the victims of oil and gas pollution how practical has this been today One thing to 
note here therefore is the provision of section 20 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria as amended The section states that “The state shall protect and improve 
the environment and safeguard the water air and land forest and wildlife of Nigeria” Looking 
at this provision there is no constructive and enforceable rights spelt out In otherwords the 
provision creates no binding obligation or legally enforceableright it merely directs the state on 
its polices and does not act as a positive source of any right for anybody who feels that the 
provisions have been infringed upon 
The other provision of the law is that of section 331 and 34 of the constitution as 
regards the right to life and integrity of human person respectively Section 331of the 
constitution which expressly provides for right  to life does not appear to be adhered to in Niger 
Delta in relation the oil pollution and the sufferings of the inhabitants of the areas 
The case of Jonah Gbemre v Shell Petroleum envelopment Company Nigeria Ltd  
Ors Is instructive in that case the court held that…  
The constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights to life and dignity of human 
person provide in sections 331 and 341 of the Constitution of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria 1999 reinforced by articles 4 16 and 24 of the African 
Charter on Human and People’s Rights Ratification and Enforcement Act Cap 
A9 vol 1 laws of the federation of Nigeria2004 inevitably includes the right of 
clean poison free pollution free and healthy  environment… the action of the 1st 
and 2ndrespondents in continuing to flare gas in the course of their oil exploitation 
and production activities in the Applicant’s community is a violation of their 
fundamental rights to life including healthy environment and dignity of human 
person guaranteed by section 331 and 341 of the Constitution of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria 1999 and reinforced by Articles 4 16 and 24 of the African 
Charter on Human and People’s Rights Ratification and Enforcement Act Cap 
A9 vol 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 Obutte  Idiaghe 2018 p 
64 
 
The facts of the above case is that the claimant a native of one of the oil producing communities 
in Delta State Nigeria where the respondent was flaring gas went to court for himself and for 
his community to stop the oil company from flaring gas in the said community At the court of 
first instance the court held that gas flaring constitutes a breach of fundamental rights therefore 
ordered the defendants to stop it The case was affirmed by the Appeal Court but the issue is 
that until now the company has not stopped flaring there which violates the right of the people 
to life as stated above

In another case of Ikechukwu Opera Ors v Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
Nigeria Limited  Ors which has similar facts with that of Jonah Gbemre the Federal High 
Court Port Harcourt Division was of the view that gas flaring was not covered by the rights 
under Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Obutte  Idiaghe 
2018 
Yet in another case of Social and Economic Right Action Center for Economic and 
Social Right v Nigeria Nwobike 2005 a matter brought against Shell’s Operations in 
Orgniland the Commission could only urge Nigeria as to what to do and no more even though 
Nigeria was found to have breached a number of provisions of the Charter including Articles 
2416182122 and 24 
In a further development thousand of Ogonis were detained or assaulted by the Rivers 
State Interactional Security Taskforce for exercising their fundamental rights In 1994 Ken 
Sarowiwa and several others were accused of the murder of traditional leaders in Oganiland 
and subsequently executed by the military government on November 10 1995 after a trial 
which violated International Standards The execution of Ken Sarowiwa followed by other 
repressive actions by the government of Nigeria designed to coerce or silence the oil producing 
communities against any kind of agitation in furtherance of their human right Nixon 1996

Human Rights Practice in other Jurisdictions  
 
a 
South Africa  
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa in Section 24 of entrenches a 
substantive environmental right which among other things provides du Plessis 2018 
 
Everyone has the right to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well 
beings and  
 
To have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations 
through reasonable legislative and other measures that 
• 
Prevent pollution and ecological degradation 
• 
Promote conservation and  
• 
Secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while 
promoting justifiable and social development 
To this extent therefore it is pertinent to say here that the provisions of section 24 of the 
South African Constitution above makes it possible for individuals to assert their rights against 
the state and any individual whose activities may negatively affect their rights The provision 
has empowered the citizens to enforce their environmental rights to life and dignity du Plessis 
2018 Section 24a particularly has provided a classical or traditional fundamental right that 
guarantees the right to life and human dignity Even though environmental rights are 
traditionally classified as 3rd generation rights section 24a is rather an individual justiciable 
right which may be invoked by individual where this right is breached by the state or private 
person or corporate body’s activity In other words the constitution does not only guarantee a 
right to environment but makes this right legally enforceable by the courts There are no indeed 
noouster clauses that prohibits the jurisdiction of the court from deciding whether or not this 
rights has been violated du Plessis 2018 
Also the South African courts have taken the issue of human rights to the next level 
The Grootbooms case decided by the South African Constitutional courts which is the highest 
court on environmental matters sets out an unprecedented and promising approach to judicial 
protection of environmental rights Schellack et al 2018 The facts of this case is that 900 
plaintiffs who were citizens of South Africa by birth for a long period of time spanning over 80 
years lived in an informal squatter settlement more particularly known as Wallacedene Most of 
Adams AdogaIkong Patience Tah Besong Oil Pollution in Nigerian…|97 
 
 
 
the people were desperately poor living from hand to mouth All of them lived in squatter 
shacks without water sewage system or refuse removal services Only 5 of the shacks had 
electricity The named plaintiff Irene Grootboom lived with her family and that of her sister in a 
shack of about twenty square metres Schellack et al 2018 
Many of those at the wallacedine settlement had applied for lowcost housing from the 
municipality They were placed on waiting list where they remained for a number of years In 
late 1998 they became frustrated by intolerable and deplorable conditions of wallacedine and 
decided to move out and put up shacks and shelters on vacant land that was privately owned and 
earmarked for formal lowcost housing 
A few months later the owner obtained an ejectment order against them but 
Grootboom and others refused to leave They contended that their former sites were 
nowoccupied and that there was nowhere else to go Eventually they were forcibly evicted with 
their homes burnt and bulldozed Their possession were all destroyed  They found on a 
sportfield in wallacedire under temporary structures consisting of plastic sheets Their 
conditions was even worst here 
It was at this point that they contended that their constitutional rights had been 
breached the constitutional court held interalia first that the right to health of the plaintiffs was 
justiciable Second the court held that the right to adequate housing under Section 261 of the 
Constitution was enforceable The court found finally that Section 26 of the Constitution was 
breached  
 
b 
India 
 
India is arguably one of the most progressive countries that has given due attention to 
judiciary awareness and application of contemporary concepts including environmental rights 
and notions of sustainable development Smithers 2015 The constitution imposed on 
obligation to protect the citizens of India Part IV of the Constitution called the Directive 
Principles of State Policy has imposed certain fundamental duties on the state to protect the 
environment Article 47 particularly imposed on the state to raise the level of nutrition and the 
standard of living of its people and improve public health Article48a expressly directs the 
state to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests and wildlife Smithers 
2015 
One interesting thing to note is that Indian courts have breathed life into the above 
provisions by linking and enforcing these and related issues to the constitutionallyguaranteed 
rights to life contained in Article 21 Smithers 2015 Indeed since 1990s the supreme court of 
India has stated on unequivocal terms that issues of human rights and environment must and 
shall receive the highest attention Thus it laid down new principles reinterpreted old ones 
create new institutions and structures and conferring additional powers all aimed at protecting 
human and environmental rights In M C Mehta v Union India the supreme court of India 
held that these directive principles Article 39b 47 and 48a individually or collectively 
impose a duty on the state to create conditions to improve the general health level in the country 
and to protect and improve the natural environment Mehta 1988 In Rural Litigation and 
Entitlement Kendra v State of Uttar Pradesh the supreme court held that the people of Dehra 
dun have the right to live in a healthy environment thus ordered the mining operation in the 
area to cease despite the amount of money and time the company had invested Singh 2019 In 
Vellore Citizen Welfare Forum v Union of India the supreme court of India noted that although 
the leather industry is a major foreign exchange earner of India and provided employment it 
does not mean that this industry has the right to destroy the ecology degrade the environment or 
create health hazards Shamim 2015

CONCLUSION 
 
 
Amidst the current and global trends on human right today Nigerian has not fully 
embraced it particularly in the area of the victims of oil pollution In other jurisdictions like 
India and South Africa human rights especially the environmental right has come to stay In 
India for instance the constitution imposed an obligation to protect the citizens of India This is 
seen in Part IV Article 47 48a especially Also in the Indian case of Olga TellisOrs v 
Bambay Municipal Corp  Ors the Indian Supreme Court held to the effect that the right to 
livelihood is a necessary component of the right of life On the other hand in South Africa the 
issue of human rights as well as environmental rights is taken seriously Section 24 of the South 
Africa Constitution for instance provides that Everyone has the right to an environment that is 
not harmful to their health as well aswellbeing and to prevent pollution and economical 
degradation… The implication and interpretation of this Section 24 is to the effect that 
individuals  can asserts their right against the state and against any individuals whose activities 
may negatively affect their rights Also in South Africa the Popular Grrotbooms case where the 
court held interaliat hat the right of health of the plaintiff was justiciable is very instructive 
 
Looking at the positive happening in the other jurisdictions above where both the 
constitution as well as the courts have taken proactive move to ascertain the right of the 
individuals it is suggested that Nigeria should follow suit in this 21st century This is because a 
situation where the victims of oil pollution in Nigeria are left with little or no human rights to 
enforce in the case where their rights to life is infringed upon is not imagined let alone 
condoned Archibong et al 2016 AdogaIkong  Takim 2017 
In the light of the above it is recommended that Section 20 of the 1999 Constitution 
dealing with the right to environment be removed from Chapter II to where it can be made 
justiciable or the Section is interpreted by the court to be justiciable Again it is suggested that 
Nigeria follow the current trend in South Africa India Ghana Bangladesh etc where their 
courts have applied their interpretative jurisdictions to inject justiciable life into their 
fundamental objectives and directive principles 
Nigerian government should embark on creating environmental courts which will 
handle environmental issues separately and speedily too This will enhance the right of victims 
of oil pollution access to justice Finally it is suggested that the right to life under Section 33 
and 34 of the Constitution of Nigeria incorporate the right to environment This will enable the 
victims of oil pollution assert their rights adequately
