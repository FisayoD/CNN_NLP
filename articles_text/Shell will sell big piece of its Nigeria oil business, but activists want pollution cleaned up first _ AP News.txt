Shell called it a way to streamline its business in a country it has operated in for decades facing pushback
about oil spills that have fouled rivers and farms and exacerbated tensions in a region that has faced years of
militant violence
“This agreement marks an important milestone for Shell in Nigeria aligning with our previously announced
intent to exit onshore oil production in the Niger Delta” Zoe Yujnovich Shell’s integrated gas and upstream
director said in a statement This will help in “simplifying our portfolio and focusing future disciplined
investment in Nigeria on our deepwater and integrated gas position”
The buying consortium is Renaissance which consists of ND Western Aradel Energy First EP Waltersmith
and Petrolin Shell said After an initial payment of 13 billion the Londonbased energy giant said it would
receive an additional 11 billion
