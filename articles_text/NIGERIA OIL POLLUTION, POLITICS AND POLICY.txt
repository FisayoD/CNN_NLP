Abstract The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative GoMRI was established in 2010 with 500 million in
funding provided by British Petroleum over a 10‐year period to support research on the impacts of the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill and recovery Contributions of the GoMRI program to date focused on human
health are presented in more than 32 peer‐reviewed papers published between 2011 and May 2019 Primary
ﬁndings from review of these papers are i the large quantity of dispersants used in the oil cleanup have been
associated with human health concerns including through obesogenicity toxicity and illnesses from
aerosolization of the agents ii oil contamination has been associated with potential for increases in harmful
algal blooms and numbers of pathogenic Vibrio bacteria in oil‐impacted waters and iii members of Gulf
communities who are heavily reliant upon natural resources for their livelihoods were found to be vulnerable
to high levels of life disruptions and institutional distrust Positive correlations include a ﬁnding that a
high level of community attachment was beneﬁcial for recovery Actions taken to improve disaster response
and reduce stress‐associated health effects could lessen negative impacts of similar disasters in the future
Furthermore GoMRI has supported annual conferences beginning in 2013 at which informative human
health‐related presentations have been made Based on this review it is recommended that the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990 be updated to include enhanced funding for oil spill impacts to human health
1 Introduction
On 20 April 2010 the largest oil spill in US history to that time began when the Deepwater Horizon DWH
drilling rig failed This failure resulted in ﬁres and subsequent explosion of the rig taking the lives of 11
workers on board and releasing approximately 49 million barrels 205 million gallons of crude oil into
the Gulf of Mexico GOM over a period of 3 months Tao et al 2011 The cleanup response was extensive
requiring thousands of workers including professional ﬁshermen engineers technicians and scientists
Response efforts involved continuous submersible operation MacDonald et al 2014 the use of approxi
mately 835 skimmers and 9000 vessels and declarations of states of emergency in each of the GOM
States US Coast Guard 2011 Beaches were closed oiled wildlife were collected and extensive precautions
were taken to prevent seafood contamination including closure of commercial and recreational ﬁsheries
over 37 of GOM federal ﬁsheries waters see Section 4 US Coast Guard 2011
Oil contamination is not only a concern for the environment but also for human health However effects of
crude oil on human health have not been well studied Woodward 2010 although recent efforts such as the
National Institutes of Health NIH GuLF STUDY Kwok et al 2017 and the Coast Guard Study Rusiecki
et al 2018 are adding much new information Within a few weeks after the DWH oil spill British
Petroleum BP announced a 500 million fund for research on the environmental and health impacts of
the spill The 10‐year‐long Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative GoMRI was created as an independent entity
responsible to use those funds for research and education related to the spill httpgulfresearchinitiative
org In its ﬁrst years of operation as its organizational structure was being established block grant funding
was awarded to each of the ﬁve Gulf States and to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
NIEHS totaling 45 million to initiate research and establish baseline data for subsequent studies This
initial funding included money to support a Coast Guard cohort study Rusiecki et al 2018 The research
supported by this 45‐million award was not under the overview of the GoMRI and so was not considered
in this review GoMRI issued its ﬁrst call for research proposals in January 2011 and employing a peer
review process similar to that of the National Science Foundation awarded 15 million in grants for data

collection and monitoring In the ﬁrst of a series of formal requests for proposals RFP‐I in August 2011
funding totaling 110 million to be spent over 3 years was awarded to eight research consortia The second
request for proposals RFP‐II resulted in awards of 185 million in August 2012 for 19 research projects
focused on GoMRIs ﬁve research themes To ﬁll a funding gap between 1 July 2011 and 30 September
2011 RFP‐III granted 15 million in bridge grants to 17 projects to ensure vital continuity of sampling In
January 2015 RFP‐IV awards totaled 140 million that was provided to 12 research consortia In a shift to
individual investigator proposals the following year 22 proposals amounting to 38 million were funded
in January 2016 under RFP‐V with public health proposals receiving the largest proportion of the overall
award In January 2018 a total of 50 million in grants funded 31 research proposals a mix of consortia
and individual investigator projects under RFP‐VI GoMRI nd Additional information about GoMRI
and a complete list of GoMRI‐supported publications can be accessed from its website httpsgulfresearch
initiativeorg
The ﬁve GoMRI research themes for which funds were provided were “physical distribution dispersion and
dilution of petroleum oil and gas its constituents and associated contaminants eg dispersants under
the action of physical oceanographic processes air sea interactions and tropical storms chemical evolution
and biological degradation of the petroleumdispersant systems and subsequent interaction with coastal
open‐ocean and deep‐water ecosystems environmental effects of the petroleumdispersant system on the
sea ﬂoor water column coastal waters beach sediments wetlands marshes and organisms and the science
of ecosystem recovery technology developments for improved response mitigation detection characteriza
tion and remediation associated with oil spills and gas releases and impact of oil spills on public health
including behavioral socioeconomic environmental risk assessment community capacity and
other population health considerations and issues” GoMRI nd emphasis added
As GoMRI neared the end of its 10‐year lifespan the Research Board funded a series of workshops and other
activities to review scientiﬁc progress made through GoMRIs efforts since the DWH spill in 2010 and com
missioned synthesis of eight core areas of research including human health
GoMRI employed “public health” in its original statement of research themes and as one of the organizing
headings for publications but “human health” was subsequently used to describe one of the synthesis core
areas Human health is a more encompassing term including public population health and health and
well‐being of individuals families and groups and encompasses both the psychological and physiological
health of those different units of study as well as the interrelationships occurring among them We there
fore chose to use human health to describe the focus of our study
Our literature review provides a summary of human health‐oriented publications resulting from research
funded by GoMRI and speciﬁcally identiﬁed as public health contributions on the GoMRI website
Supporting Information Table S1 Papers not identiﬁed by GoMRI as resulting from its funding and having
a human health focus were not included In addition GoMRI was the principal supporter of the Gulf of
Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science GOMOSES conferences initiated in 2013 and held annually there
after The GOMOSES forum provided an additional method for GoMRI to support human health research
outside of direct funding through the dissemination of ﬁndings and is therefore included in this synthesis
The number of oral and poster presentations on human health at the GOMOSES conferences were tallied as
another metric of human health‐related contributions Thus the purpose of this paper is to summarize the
contributions of GoMRI to human health research via the lens of health‐related publications that resulted
from GoMRI funding and the numbers of health presentations that were enabled by GoMRI through the
GOMOSES annual conferences it supported

work contributes signiﬁcantly to our understanding of how oil spills and remediation efforts impact public
and human health Our judgment that the papers supported by GoMRI taken together comprise a
signiﬁcant contribution to oil spill health research is based on our familiarity with a much broader
literature on the topic the fact that several different facets of health were included among the papers and
the relative high proportion of health‐focused papers compared to literature from previous oil spills
Murphy et al 2016 Further additional health‐related papers are in preparation or under review and
not yet available for inclusion For example two currently funded projects are examining human lung
models to evaluate effects of dispersants Also publications related to toxic effects of oil and dispersants
on nonhuman organisms were not included but some may have indirect relevance to human health
Because these were beyond the scope of this review our ﬁndings should be considered only a portion of
the GoMRI contribution to the human health literature In addition the funds included in the ﬁrst year of
block funding for the NIEHS were not under GoMRI Research Board oversight Hence any publications
resulting from that support were not included in this review
For purposes of this review the literature is grouped into four general categories dispersants oil contami
nation human studies and disaster planning and response Studies with overlapping categories are grouped
according to their primary focus We employed this organizational scheme to improve the ﬂow of the paper
and make it easier for readers to ﬁnd information of particular interest to them
3 Dispersants
The marine ecosystem of the GOM absorbed a “very large dose of toxic hydrocarbons and dispersant” as a
result of the DWH oil catastrophe MacDonald et al 2014 p 1 Cleanup efforts utilized a variety of methods
including surface and subsurface applications of two chemical dispersants Corexit 9500 and 9527A to break
up the oil More than 18 million gallons of Corexit were released throughout the GOM prompting scientiﬁc
inquiry regarding effects of dispersant‐oil mixtures on human and marine populations Human‐related stu
dies focused on potential impacts of aerosolized oil‐dispersant mixtures and the possibility that dispersants
had obesogenic promoting obesity in humans effects
Dispersants used on large oil spills reduce interfacial tension between seawater and oil leading to increased
marine aerosol emissions Afshar‐Mohajer et al 2018 studied aerosolization of volatile organic compounds

VOCs and magniﬁcation of marine aerosol emissions after an oil spill Researchers used a 6 × 03 × 06‐m
tank to simulate wave patterns colliding with oil slicks To determine aerosol particle size distribution tests
were conducted measuring seawater with crude oil slicks crude oil and dispersant mixtures and dispersant
only Afshar‐Mohajer et al 2018 Results revealed that seawater mixed with crude oil only showed similar
distribution of submicron particle sizes to that of seawater free of contaminants but addition of dispersants
mixed with crude oil to seawater decreased VOC concentration by two to three times while increasing the
concentration of nanoparticles across all nano sizes measured Afshar‐Mohajer et al 2018 The authors
noted that reduction in water surface tension is responsible for the increased concentration of aerosolized
particles explaining why dispersant‐oil mixtures are found to have highest concentration of particulate mat
ter PM Their results suggest that the human health concern of aerosolized VOCs is reduced following dis
persant application but point to other possible human health risks related to PM inhalation and subsequent
buildup in the pulmonary system when dispersants are used in remediation efforts
In a following study Afshar‐Mohajer et al 2019 did a health risk assessment of aerosolized VOCs and ﬁne
PM inhalation Adding dispersant 125 to crude oil slicks on water surfaces resulted in lower VOC concen
tration and “dispersant helped reduce the cancer risk of exposure to benzene the main carcinogen emitted
from the crude oil slick” Afshar‐Mohajer et al 2019 p 931 While the lifetime cancer risk was reduced
from 57 to 37 cases per million when using dispersants potential exposures were still above the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health acceptable risk limit On the other hand addition of dispersant
increased PM inhalation magnifying the human respiratory system burden by a factor of 10 Findings indi
cate that the use of dispersants confer disparate inﬂuences to human health risks with their addition to
crude oil resulting in reduction of health risks from VOCs while increasing the respiratory burden from
PM inhalation However the health threats from VOCs remained much higher than those posed by PM
inhalation both before and after application of dispersants The authors noted that times of exposure over
1 hr led to exceedances in several health thresholds and thus recommended caution should be taken by those
in close proximity to seawater contaminated with oil
Baatz et al 2014 advanced methodology for analyzing respiratory impacts by developing a new and inno
vative method for rapid cryopreservation of human lung tissue using a process of “pseudo‐diaphragmatic
expansion of pieces of fresh lung tissue with cryoprotectant formulation” abbreviated as PDX‐CP followed
by cryostorage Baatz et al 2014 p 411 This new method can enhance biospecimen banking of lung tissue
making more materials available for research particularly in relation to lung cancers Although not speciﬁ
cally mentioned by the authors their method may also be useful in providing material for future studies of
pulmonary impact of inhaled oil components and oil‐dispersant mixtures on humans exposed to an oil spill
Traditional models of decreasing caloric intake while increasing physical activity have dominated obesity
research Grün  Blumberg 2006 However mounting evidence of environmental exposures linked to obe
sity has inspired research into potential obesogens in the environment Under the environmental obesity
model Grün and Blumberg 2006 p S50 deﬁne obesogens as “molecules that inappropriately regulate lipid
metabolism and adipogenesis to promote obesity” Oil and dispersants have been reported to be potential
endocrine disruptors Adedara et al 2014 and Ramachandran et al 2004 found that dispersants
increased the bioavailability of oil components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs in ﬁsh
Water samples were collected on two separate occasions by the team on the NOAA research vessel Ocean
Veritas 27–29 May and 2–4 June 2010 from the surface and at various depths in the GOM Gray et al
2014 Corexit dispersants were identiﬁed and calculated to be in the 100–200 ppb range in the water column
Gray et al 2014 Kujawinski et al 2011 strongly suggesting a need for research into potential exposure
effects on humans
Bowers et al 2016 and Temkin et al 2016 explored the possibility that dispersants used in the DWH
cleanup effort may act as an obesogen for humans Both investigator teams focused on a probable obesogen
dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate DOSS a component of Corexit the main dispersant mixture used in DWH
cleanup Rusiecki et al 2018 Because the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor
gamma PPARγ is vital to adipocyte differentiation and is the main target of obesogens Temkin et al
2016 used PPARγ transactivation assays to identify putative obesogens In laboratory experiments employ
ing mice DOSS was found to activate the PPARγ gene leading to the conclusion that DOSS is a potential
obesogen Temkin et al 2016

Two components of Corexit Span 80 and DOSS are surfactants also commonly used in food and drink pro
ducts US Food and Drug Administration nd air fresheners and personal care products US
Department of Health and Human Services 2018 Bowers et al 2016 tested DOSS and Span 80 for additive
effects promoting adipogenesis and thereby obesity Experiments were conducted using cell cultures in the
laboratory DOSS and Span 80 were found to work synergistically resulting in substantially “more adipocyte
differentiation than treatment with either compound individually” Bowers et al 2016 p 65 These results
highlight the potential of unintended adverse side effects when DOSS and Span 80 are used as food additives
and in dispersants to treat oil spills and point to the need to understand possible human health effects if any
from oil spills treated with dispersants
4 Oil Contamination
Many environmental contamination studies were conducted following the DWH oil spill in the GOM DWH
spill‐driven contaminants have been linked to pulmonary health issues in human populations Lenes et al
2013 Walsh et al 2016 and shown to be a cause of ﬁsh kills Dickey  Huettel 2016 and contamination of
seafood Smith et al 2011 Tao et al 2011 Xia et al 2012 GoMRI‐funded studies have also focused on oil
spill impacts linked to the Florida red tide organism Karenia brevis pathogenic Vibrio bacteria and seafood
safety Dickey  Huettel 2016 Lenes et al 2013 Smith et al 2011 Walsh et al 2017 Harmful algal
blooms HABs in the form of K brevis and possible contamination with Vibrio spp are considered health
risks for human populations in the GOM
HABs occur when algal populations proliferate resulting in detrimental effects on humans and marine life
Spill‐driven contaminants can cause trophic cascades contributing to these blooms Weisberg et al 2016
studied HAB formation by K brevis on the west coast of Florida where the algal bloom occurs regularly
between Tampa and Charlotte Harbor They were able to conﬁrm that K brevis blooms originate offshore
and move to near shore waters via subsurface onshore advection Weisberg et al Weisberg et al 2016 p
118 found that upwelling was a “necessary condition for bloom delivery near shore” but that strong upwel
ling could result in diminution of a bloom since it allows for faster growing diatoms and other phytoplankton
to outcompete K brevis They also noted that eutrophication excessive nutrient pollution of near shore
waters likely contributes to bloom intensiﬁcation but is not the primary initiating factor
Release of toxic compounds brevetoxins by K brevis during a red tide bloom causes ﬁsh kills harms marine
mammals and other species and is highly dangerous for humans as well Water turbulence and biological
processes result in lysis of K brevis cells and the subsequent release of brevetoxins into the water column
Following cell lysis toxins accumulate in the water aerosolize and are transported by winds causing or
exacerbating asthma attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among those living in coastal
regions Lenes et al 2013 In laboratory studies Lenes et al 2013 found that rats inhaling brevetoxins pro
duced by K brevis PbTx‐3 were left with reduced antibody formation and an impaired immune system
They noted that asthmatic humans with PbTx‐3 immunosuppression were found to be subject to fatal pneu
monia Walsh et al 2016 p 69 termed these landward‐dispersed aerosolized toxins “marine HAB triggers”
for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease They estimated that 48 of carbon sequestered in
HAB cells on the West Florida Shelf became aerosolized and transported in wind‐blown spray
Walsh et al 2017 conducted a global analysis of how reduced zooplankton populations and consequently
lowered phytoplankton grazing rates accompanied by a variety of anthropogenic impacts including over
ﬁshing and oil spills resulted in increases in HAB formation and aerosolization of HAB toxins They esti
mated that landward dispersion of aerosolized HAB toxins was responsible for 15 of asthma events
worldwide in 2004 affecting 45 million people and perhaps killing as many as 33000 In addition they
identiﬁed the potential for HAB aerosols to also carry methyl mercury MeHg and other contaminants
and suggested that as much as 40 of mercury poisonings from marine sources may be derived from HAB
aerosols rather than from ﬁsh consumption These estimates suggest much more signiﬁcant and broad scale
health threats from HABs than previously recognized Walsh et al 2016 concluded that plankton levels are
out of balance within the GOM due to overﬁshing release of heavy metals and pesticides and oil spills with
likely results being a trophic cascade and a drastic increase in pulmonary issues for those nearby Not sur
prisingly they also pointed to the need for operational HAB forecasting to aid in the prevention of pulmon
ary diseases Walsh et al 2016

The DWH oil spill caused an increased concern about shellﬁsh contamination in the GOM Dickey 
Huettel 2016 Vibrio spp are relatively well‐studied bacteria because they include important human patho
gens occur naturally in coastal waters play critical roles in the carbon cycle and are highly efﬁcient decom
posers including of some components of oil Tao et al 2011 Vibrio parahaemolyticus causes
gastrointestinal illnesses and is the leading cause of seafood‐borne illness from consuming raw improperly
cooked or contaminated seafood Smith et al 2011 Concern that the oil spill might encourage blooms of V
parahaemolyticus and lead to an increased risk of shellﬁsh contamination post spill prompted Smith et al
2011 to assess the response of V parahaemolyticus strains local to the GOM to PAHs of crude oil They
assessed growth responses of 17 V parahaemolyticus isolates from coastal Louisiana on two PAHs and found
that neither encouraged growth of the bacteria and that a degradation product of one of the PAHs inhibited
V parahaemolyticus growth Their work conﬁrmed previous research that had suggested little additional
risk from V parahaemolyticus related to oil spills
In a related study Tao et al 2011 examined weathered oil that washed up on Mississippi and Alabama bea
ches forming tar balls to determine if the highly pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulniﬁcus was associated with
tar balls V vulniﬁcus is of particular concern because it is the primary cause of seafood‐based human mor
tality in the United States Contact with V vulniﬁcus in seawater can infect wounds and abrasions with fatal
ity rates of 20–30 Tao et al 2011 These researchers found not only that counts of total aerobic bacteria
were “signiﬁcantly higher in tar ball samples than in any other sample analyzed” Tao et al 2011 p 509 but
that levels of V vulniﬁcus in tar balls were 10 times higher than observed in sand samples and up to 100 times
higher than in seawater This information suggests a potentially severe health threat to humans who may
come in contact with tar balls as direct contact of V vulniﬁcus with even small open wounds can lead to
life‐threatening infections Tao et al 2011 This ﬁnding may serve as the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of tar balls as
a potentially serious human health risk for infectious disease
Huettel et al 2018 studied degradation of buried oil post‐DWH spill on Floridas Pensacola Beach and the
role of tidal pumping in oil degradation They noted the importance of maintaining oxygenated environ
ments for microbial degradation of oil on beaches citing previous reports that microbial degradation of
oil occurs quickly in aerobic environments but nearly stops under anaerobic situations such as in sub
merged microbial mats Huettel et al found abundance of bacteria in oiled sand increased by a factor of
two while bacterial diversity declined by 50 reﬂecting a bloom of oil‐degrading bacterial species
Importantly they found that tidal pumping was a signiﬁcant factor in oxygenating beach sediments with
a strongly positive effect on cleaning up oil deposited on Pensacola Beach However Huettel et al also noted
that oil buried on shore can be a source of PAHs for decades after a spill and that even to the present day
residual surface tar balls wash ashore following storms and may result in human exposure to V vulniﬁcus
bacteria Tao et al 2011 as well as probable obesogens Temkin et al 2016
Several studies analyzed seafood contamination linked to the DWH spill At the peak of the oil spill in
June 2010 88552 square miles 37 of Federal waters in the GOM were closed to ﬁshing US Coast
Guard 2011 The Federal closures were related to concern for potential contamination of seafood with
oil components and depending on the area ﬁsheries were closed for 3–7 months with a small area closed
for a year Xia et al 2012 analyzed 278 seafood samples consisting of ﬁshes shrimps crabs and oysters
collected weekly from 27 May 2010 until October 2010 and monthly until August 2011 These researchers
compared PAH levels detected to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Mussel
Watch program for the prior 10 years and found no signiﬁcant difference in concentration The PAH
levels in GOM seafood were similar to levels found in grocery store and restaurant‐grade seafood and
far below public health levels of concern established jointly by NOAA the US Food and Drug
Administration and Gulf Coast states Xia et al 2012 In a review paper that summarized seafood safety
information obtained from 10000 Gulf samples including the work of Xia et al as well as beach data
Dickey and Huettel 2016 reported that concentrations of potentially harmful oil components were at
prespill levels soon after the end of the spill although residual oil in waters and sediment could provide
potential for ongoing exposures They also noted concerns that existing seafood safety limits for oil com
pounds may not provide sufﬁcient protection for certain vulnerable populations such as pregnant women
children and ethnic groups that are high consumers of seafood eg Vietnamese‐American ﬁshers
Dickey and Huettel p 201 concluded that “the DWH accident revealed the lack of adequate demo
graphic and human health baseline data benchmark environmental contaminant data effective risk

5 Psychosocial Studies
The DWH spill has been a long‐lasting life event for residents of the GOM disrupting routine behavior
increasing anxiety straining economic resources and negatively affecting mental health Ayer et al
2019 Those employed in and dependent upon the oil and ﬁshing industries were particularly vulnerable
suffering disproportionately during and after the disaster Ayer et al 2019 Cope et al 2013 Cope et al
2016 Cope  Slack 2017 Lee  Blanchard 2012 Parks et al 2017
Mental and behavioral health were studied in Gulf residents affected by the spill by Lee and Blanchard
2012 Cope et al 2013 and Cope and Slack 2017 with emphasis on how community attachment affects
mental health Populations most vulnerable were those with high levels of economic social and cultural
attachment to threatened damaged or depleted resources Cope et al 2013 According to the ecological
symbolic theory natural resource‐dependent communities experience long‐term stress impacts when
renewable resources are endangered Lee  Blanchard 2012 Rural communities traditionally reliant on
resource‐based economies have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to risks and disruptions associated
with a disaster Cope  Slack 2017 Cope and Slack used county‐level demographic data and socioeco
nomic status to calculate an index of place‐based social vulnerability developed by Cutter et al 2003 called
the Social Vulnerability Index Social vulnerability is asserted to be just as important as physical exposure to
oil spills Cope  Slack 2017 in terms of effects on health and well‐being Vulnerable populations were
found to have increased psychological stress after the DWH spill Cope et al 2013 Lee  Blanchard
2012 but researchers found that strong community attachment was connected to better outcomes for
families increased individual well‐being and positive mental and physical health outcomes Cope et al
2013 but this may not hold for all situations
Ayer et al 2019 hypothesized that exposure to DWH would be related to depression anxiety alcohol abuse
and illness anxiety deﬁned by Ayer et al 2019 p 2 as “excessive concern or worry about having or getting a
serious illness” 6 years post spill Researchers in that study analyzed impacts of other past traumatic experi
ences along with self‐reported exposure to the DWH spill to assess the inﬂuence of each factor on occurrence
of mental health problems weighting for gender and age From 22 April to 6 August 2016 Ayer et al con
ducted 2520 telephone interviews in 45 coastal GOM counties They found that trauma history was the most
signiﬁcant predictor for each of the outcomes Yet exposure to the DWH spill did not predict depression
anxiety or alcohol use beyond past exposure to traumatic events but was signiﬁcantly associated with
illness anxiety
Drakeford et al 2019 explored religious inﬂuence on alcohol consumption in the wake of natural disasters
such as the DWH spill Environments with high levels of religious practice have long been thought to help
mitigate disaster impacts for members through increased social support and enhanced social resources
Drakeford et al 2019 However recent research suggests highly religious contexts may have a negative
impact on nonreligious community members as they may experience difﬁculty gaining the same levels of
support as religious members Stroope  Baker 2018 Drakeford et al theorized such contexts may lead
to increased maladaptive coping methods such as problematic alcohol consumption To test this hypothesis

related social inconvenience Drakeford et al 2019 Findings indicate that while religious contexts are not

Parks et al 2017 p 278 analyzed “lifeway disruption” to determine the degree to which the DWH spill
affected routine behaviors of people in impacted communities According to the conservation of resources
theory those directly tied to the renewable resource‐based industries affected are more likely to have nega
tive impacts “The COR model suggests that chronic loss of or threat to such resources especially when
coupled with an inability to develop new or alternative resources may result in a ‘loss cycle’ for residents
who are unable to adapt” Parks et al 2017 p 279 Disruptions of routine behaviors were studied through
analysis of results from the Louisiana Community Oil Spill Survey The authors found that “respondents
reported difﬁculty completing approximately one‐third of the activities” after the spill but those disruptions
decreased over time indicating recovery Parks et al 2017 p 283 Unsurprisingly Parks et al found that
residents with a ﬁshingoil career background were shown to have greater life disruptions than their coun
terparts whose employment and way of life were not directly affected
In an effort to evaluate how oil spill‐related resource loss is connected to mental and behavioral health
issues Ramchand et al 2019 used STRONG survey data to compare Gulf states prevalence estimates of
depression anxiety alcohol misuse screenings and residents health care usage 6 years post spill Overall
nearly half of adults in this study screened positive for depression anxiety or alcohol misuse while less than
20 of those individuals were engaging in mental health care Among those screened positively for depres
sion anxiety or alcohol misuse women were more likely than men and lesbian gay or bisexual residents
were more likely than nonlesbian gay or bisexual residents to have visited a mental health provider in
the past 12 months Those working in the ﬁshing and seafood industry during the DWH spill were more
likely to screen positive for depression and higher levels of resource loss were positively correlated with
depression and anxiety symptoms Ramchand et al 2019
Disruptions in routine behavior following a disaster perpetuate long‐term consequences and increase stress
surrounding the event These social disruptions pose a threat to community attachment and could make
recovering from a disaster in a timely manner more difﬁcult How well individuals and communities adapt
to and recover from disaster‐related adverse conditions is measured in terms of resilience Patel et al 2018
In human health and disaster contexts resilience can be understood as the relationship between risk and
protective factors Patel et al 2018 Risk factors can include low socioeconomic status poor education past
trauma being of a minority group and lack of an adequate support structure in addition to others whereas
protective elements include having a positive outlook social ties community involvement spirituality and
others Bonanno 2004 Neenan 2009
Federal data indicate that approximately one in four shrimpers in the GOM are members of the Southeast
Asian community predominantly Vietnamese Americans Macchi 2015 a potentially vulnerable popula
tion after the DWH spill due to their natural resource dependence Patel et al 2018 however hypothesized
that Vietnamese Americans along the Gulf Coast would have higher levels of resilience because of their close
community ties Researchers examined the resilience levels of those identifying as Vietnamese within the
Gulf Coast communities of Port Sulphur LA Galliano LA and Bayou La Batre AL through in‐person inter
views and surveys using the 10‐item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale Nearly the entire sample of those
who identiﬁed as Vietnamese 9867 74 out of 75 such participants were from Bayou La Batre AL and
those identifying as Vietnamese made up 242 of the total sample of 326 people Patel et al 2018
Results indicated that higher age and higher level of college education were associated with increased resili
ence while identifying as Vietnamese was related to a 20 lower resilience score compared to other ethnic or
racial identities However the authors did not control for natural resource dependency Patel et al concluded
that further work is needed to understand the causes of apparent reduced resilience in the Vietnamese
American population and to better support and equip such communities to deal with negative events
Cope et al 2016 studied how the DWH spill affected residents blame and trust in institutions over a 3‐year
period following the event At each yearly anniversary of the rig explosion the authors measured blame for
the consequences of the disaster and distrust in three institutional actors—BP federal government and state
government Baseline data collected in October 2010 showed distrust in both BP and the federal government
was similarly high among respondents in the study while distrust in state government was signiﬁcantly

lower Perceptions of blame at the baseline revealed that BP was ﬁrmly considered the primary responsible
party 75 of respondents with the federal government serving as the second leading party for blame
50 and the state government much lower 20 Over the years of the study there was no evidence
that the views of BP or the federal government were trending better or worse over time for either trust or
blame However perceptions of blame for state government increased from their low baseline level to
32 of respondents by the studys end trust remained stable The authors additionally studied the effect
of employment in natural resource occupations on perceptions of blame and trust further dividing employ
ment into renewable ﬁshing seafood versus nonrenewable oil gas Taken cumulatively those in natural
resource occupations were more likely to blame BP and the federal government than those in other occupa
tions Households dependent on oil gas were more distrustful of the federal government than those in other
industries with no signiﬁcant difference in their trust of BP or state government The authors attributed this
ﬁnding to the combative relationship between the federal government and the oil‐gas industry with a mor
atorium placed on extraction in the GOM and stricter regulations on the industry following the lift of that
moratorium Households dependent on the ﬁshing‐seafood industry were more distrustful of all three insti
tutional actors While there was a perceived certainty of the reopening of the oil‐gas industry the authors
posited the unknown fate of the ﬁshing‐seafood industry by the close of the study window April 2013
was likely the cause of that distrust Cope et al 2016
Petrun Sayers et al 2019 used data from the STRONG telephone survey to measure the primary ways in
which individuals obtained their news and their trust levels in these sources of information outside of a dis
aster context Residents were most likely to obtain their news from television 4153 and the Internet
3284 with younger adults being more likely to report the Internet as their primary source of information
Minority populations were more likely to say that “it is very important to see their communities and people
like them reporting the news” and those with higher levels of education were more likely to place high trust
in information from academic institutions and question news distributed through social media Petrun
Sayers et al 2019 p 11 Following national trends younger adults 18–49 surveyed were found to be more
critical of news passed through social media despite being heavily reliant on Internet channels Young adults
without higher education were 238 times more likely to report word of mouth as their primary communica
tion method Older adults aged 65+ were less likely to report the internet radio and word of mouth prefer
ring more traditional news sources such as television Petrun Sayers et al 2019
6 Disaster Planning and Response
While the United States arguably has the best disaster planning and response systems in the world these still
have major limitations Disasters recurring in the GOM pose complex scenarios for response agencies
attempting to minimize negative impacts Petrun Sayers et al 2019 maintain that planning for these events
should incorporate how and when to engage and include vulnerable populations
Nicholls et al 2017 pointed to the need for emergency management ofﬁcials to recognize the ability and
usefulness of community health workers CHWs in disaster planning and response CHWs are already a
part of the community know the ins and outs and are highly trusted CHWs are able to contribute to public
health community resilience and disaster preparedness and recovery through their unique position of liv
ing within the community in which they work Nicholls et al further recommended the use of a specialized
public health and community training curriculum for CHWs developed and implemented by the University
of Southern Alabama
Sandifer and Walker 2018 reviewed disaster typology recent disaster history the resilience concept in rela
tion to disasters health impacts of disasters especially those associated with chronic stress and a variety of
problems related to disaster response in the United States Based on an extensive targeted literature review
they made eight recommendations designed to enhance the resilience of both individuals and communities
to disasters including both long‐term and short‐term health effects 1 improve disaster‐focused health pro
grams and responses 2 increase collection of predisaster health data including biomarkers 3 enhance
capacity of science and health responders 4 use natural infrastructure to reduce disaster impacts 5 better
include displaced persons in disaster responses 6 utilize nature‐based treatment for disaster‐associated
stress 7 strengthen health focus in disaster‐related laws policies and regulations and 8 develop more
equitable process for dealing with ﬁnancial aspects of disaster recovery to reduce recreancy

Outreach programs have been focusing on broader impacts of scientiﬁc work in disaster response In an
effort to further science outreach Beresford et al 2018 shared recommendations for the development
management and implementation of outreach plans These recommendations for a science outreach pro
gram based upon GoMRI perspectives are 1 to ensure feasibility and efﬁcacy involve a multidisciplinary
team at or prior to the proposal stage 2 deﬁne the strategic plan and include well‐deﬁned and measurable
goals 3 clearly deﬁne audiences and determine the most effective ways to reach them 4 be familiar with
team member skills and backgrounds and tailor outreach based on strengths of the team 5 ensure that
budgets and outreach plans are collaborative 6 determine evaluation metrics at the beginning of the pro
gram and 7 foster effective communication within the team and when communicating with constituents
and other entities Beresford et al 2018
Finucane et al  p 2 propose a self‐evaluative and adaptive systems approach to community resilience
asserting that “diverse perspectives on resilience can result in conﬂicting priorities before during and after
disasters” The Consortium for Resilient Gulf Communities CRGC uses an adaptive systems approach
within the GOM based on building trust through exploring various knowledge types Functions of the
CRGC approach are 1 support stakeholders 2 respond to stakeholder needs 3 generate practical infor
mation tools and ideas for stakeholders to address speciﬁc problems and identify priorities and 4 offer
evidence‐based guidance to stakeholders Finucane et al  Key beneﬁts to adopting an adaptive systems
approach are fostering policy and community adjustments to climate change and building interdisciplinary
relationships among researchers and community members
A following project of the CRGC reﬂected on the organizations own methodologies and practices within the
GOM A cross‐sectional in‐person study conducted in three CRGC‐partnered communities was used as a
case study for this critical reﬂection The survey sought to evaluate “the role of social networks risk percep
tion preparedness measures individual resilience and demographics as predictors of preparedness and resi
lience” for future disasters in the GOM Lesen et al 2019 p 3 After eight interviews with CHWs who were
involved with the study Lesen et al 2019 recommended that 1 disaster resilience studies should involve
the community as much as possible as those communities often see the research as valuable 2 during the
development phase researchers should consult with community partners to avoid cultural conﬂict and
obtain feedback on recruitment and research methodologies 3 cultural norms and communication meth
ods should be incorporated into researcher‐participant interactions 4 community partners should be con
sulted when deciding how to disseminate results to the community and 5 incorporating critical reﬂection
and considerations of power dynamics in communities that have disaster history can empower community
members and researchers by promoting ethically and socially just resilience research Lesen et al 2019
7 Studies Listed as Public Health but not Directly Relevant to Human Health
McCoy et al 2016 authored a tribute to and a review of the scientiﬁc legacy of the late Dr Louis J Guillette
Jr and his work as a reproductive biologist Dr Guillette was an internationally recognized leader in com
parative reproductive biology and impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals to both animals and humans
with prominent works including temperature‐dependent sex determination of reptiles GoMRI supported
some of the recent research conducted by his lab including work on the American alligator eg see
Kohno et al 2014 Kohno et al 2015 Dr Guillette and his colleagues used juvenile alligators as experimen
tal animals to study a variety of factors affecting reproductive health with some of the work producing infor
mation relevant to humans Dr Guillette was also a leader in translational research bridging from animal
studies to work on human reproduction and recently including effects of phthalate exposures in
pregnant women

health or have apparent direct relevance to human health Nonetheless Deleo et al and Washburn et al
reported toxic effects of oil or oil‐dispersant mixtures on invertebrate animals Toyota et al found that
Corexit 9500 was highly toxic to Daphnia magna during the offspring growth period at concentrations of
4–64 ppm and Paruk et al found that chronic exposure to PAHs was associated with lower body mass in

8 Human Health‐Related Presentations at GOMOSES Conferences
To gain additional insight into public health contributions of the GoMRI the ﬁrst R E and third P S
authors conducted independent reviews of oral and poster presentations at the annual GOMOSES confer
ences from its inception in 2013 through the February 2019 conference based on information in the pub
lished program and data on presentations at each conference derived from the Conference Annual
Reports available on the GoMRI website To identify human health‐focused presentations R E used speciﬁc
search terms disaster preparedness decision making economy human health resilience community toxi
city and HABs while P S examined the title of each oral and poster presentations These two methods
resulted in slightly different but overall similar results Figure 2 Table 1 with human health‐related papers
comprising 35–132 of oral and 04–92 of poster presentations annually in the more conservative esti
mates and 71–167 for oral and 04–93 for poster presentations annually in the less conservative or lib
eral counts Over the 7‐year history of the conference the number of human health‐related presentations
including both oral and poster have averaged 66–86 of total presentations with a signiﬁcant increase
in the number of presentations focused on human health in 2016 likely as a result of strong efforts by session
organizers that year

9 Discussion
The DWH oil spill response and recovery programs including those directed toward funding of research
have had signiﬁcant effects on the GOM and its residents This review focused primarily on published
peer‐reviewed articles produced from research sponsored by GoMRI and identiﬁed by GoMRI as having
either direct or potential relevance to human health researchgulfresearchinitiativeorg We did not
attempt to review the much larger collection of published GoMRI papers dealing with other environmental
impacts the transport and fate of oil physical oceanography and additional topics as these have either have
been or are being reviewed elsewhere eg see Beyer et al 2016 However we did enumerate the human
health‐related presentations at the GOMOSES conferences
Taken together the GoMRI publications constitute a valuable contribution to a scientiﬁc understanding of
the effect of oil spills on both the environment and humans While some of the previous oil spills perhaps
most notably the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 resulted in many publications it is likely that none have sur
passed the volume of scientiﬁc literature produced following the DWH oil spill
Some ﬁndings from the GoMRI literature dealing with human health deemed signiﬁcant based on our
knowledge of the larger oil spill effects literature and for their potential to inﬂuence future oil spill responses
are as follows
1 The large quantities of dispersants Corexit used to disperse the oil spilled during the DWH event raised
a number of direct and potential human health concerns including possibilities that compounds com
prising the dispersant mixture may be human obesogens and that aerosolization of oil particles mixed
with dispersants may impact human health via inhalation
2 Direct contamination with oil may be related to pulmonary problems in humans seafood safety issues
potential increase in HABs and higher populations of pathogenic Vibrio bacteria in the environment
While increased contamination of shellﬁsh by Vibrio spp was not observed tar balls were found to con
tain larger numbers of pathogenic Vibrio spp and hence may be a potential public health risk especially

from human exposure to highly virulent V vulniﬁcus Buried oil and oil‐dispersant mixtures on beaches
were also identiﬁed as possible long‐term exposure routes for PAHs and putative obesogens
3 Those who live in rural communities and are heavily reliant upon natural resource‐based employment
and lifestyles were most affected by and most vulnerable to disaster‐associated stress and to increased
prevalence of depression anxiety and alcohol misuse Those individuals also exhibited greater distrust
of the perceived primary responsible party and other institutional players Trauma history was the most
signiﬁcant predictor of a negative outcome such as depression illness anxiety and alcohol abuse
Communities having a higher level of religious practice may help mitigate negative effects of a disaster
notably for the religious community members while nonreligious individuals not able to attain such
social support reported higher levels of alcohol misuse Strong community attachment however appears
to help mitigate impacts strengthen resilience and enhance recovery in some circumstances
4 Several improvements to the US disaster response capacity that can reduce human health impact of a
future oil spill or other disasters include 1 a framework for a self‐evaluative and adaptive system 2
use of messaging methods for risk communication during a disaster event 3 training and greater use
of trusted CHWs 4 and improving community resilience via an informed focus on stress relief in disas
ter preparedness response and recovery programs
5 While direct human exposure to contaminants is an important impact of a disaster such as an oil spill of
the magnitude of the DWH potential mental and behavioral health impacts should also be of primary
concern
The body of work reviewed in this paper has contributed to our understanding of oil spills their remediation
and their impacts on human health Future oil spill cleanup efforts and public health responses should take
ﬁndings from this body of work into consideration so as to improve cleanup methods by reducing use of dis
persants or ﬁnding less potentially harmful alternatives to reduce human health impacts They also point to
the need for further studies of the risk posed by dispersant exposure to humans and other organisms The
National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine recently concluded that the use of dispersants
is justiﬁed in certain circumstances but they also highlighted the need for additional research National
Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine 2019
This assessment of GoMRI public health contributions also points to a major issue namely that more atten
tion needs to be paid to human health before and after a major oil spill or other disaster While “impact of oil
spills on public health” was identiﬁed by the GoMRI as one of its ﬁve research themes gulfresearchinitia
tiveorg the proportion of human health‐related papers produced from GoMRI‐supported research to date
is relatively modest comprising only 3 of the peer‐reviewed publications produced with GoMRI support
to date Although the GoMRI conducted a well‐advertised competition for funding for human health‐
oriented projects and provided opportunities for presentation of papers related to human impacts at its
annual GOMOSES conference a stronger focus on research education and training related to human
health effects of oil spills is essential to deal with future oil spills Nevertheless the GoMRI track record is
better by nearly a factor of three than the 1 level of human health‐focused studies reported by Murphy
et al 2016 in an extensive review of approximately 10 of all oil spill literature published between 1968
and 2015 Also at least a portion of the NIH NIEHS funding for human health research related to the
DWH was supported by a 10 million allocation from the original 45 million block grant referenced earlier
Some of this health effects literature has been reviewed by Laffon et al 2016 Lichtveld et al 2016
Croisant et al 2017 Sandifer et al 2017 Sandifer and Walker 2018 National Academies of Sciences
Engineering and Medicine 2019 among others Two large cohort studies related to health effects were also
supported by the NIH the GuLF STUDY httpsgulfstudynih Kwok et al 2017 and the US Coast Guard
Cohort Study Rusiecki et al 2018 with papers from these studies continuing to appear
With the notable exception of the ongoing large cohort studies most of the human health research efforts
external to GoMRI were supported by what appear to be one‐time multiyear funding although a number
of important studies were supported for multiple years eg see Lichtveld et al 2016 Yet none of the fund
ing agencies established ongoing core grant programs speciﬁcally targeted to human health effects of oil
spills or other disasters That GoMRI included human health studies as a priority from its beginning and over
the entirety of its 10‐year lifespan is praiseworthy The GoMRI Research Board made a distinct effort to
attract and fund research proposals focused directly on human health R Colwell GoMRI personal commu
nication Yet it is obvious that human health during and following disasters remains a nascent area of

research Much remains to be done in the future to integrate environmental and human impact studies and
especially fund research on human health impacts of oil spills If similar funding opportunities following dis
asters occur in the future additional efforts should be made to engage the public health and biomedical com
munities early in the development of research plans and funding opportunities It will also be necessary for
the human health research and development community to focus on research priorities and organize effec
tively Finally because human effect studies not related to direct oil exposure are generally not allowed
under the implementing regulations of the Oil Spill Act of 1990 Sandifer  Walker 2018 it is recom
mended that Oil Spill Act of 1990 be updated to ensure coverage for direct indirect and long‐term effects
of oil spills on the mental and physical health of humans
