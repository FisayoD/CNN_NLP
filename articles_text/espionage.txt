ABSTRACT 
Sequel to the threat posed by incessant oil spill in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria this work was conceived 
with the aim of examining the pattern of oil spillage in Etche Local Government in Rivers State of Nigeria and 
the consequent impact on the environment The study adopted the survey research design Interviews 
questionnaire and observation instruments were employed in data generation and collection Graphic illustrations 
and percentage analysis were also employed to describe the relative ratio of each factor to other factors  Result 
revealed that about 29 oil spill incidents occurred within the period under study 20012007 The volume of oil 
spilled cumulated to 4270 barrels with year 2003 having the highest 41715 barrels and year 2005 having the 
lowest 01 barrel The work concluded by recommending HSE Training Staffcontractors Improved asset 
integrity management that may include Flowline replacement Flowline burial Flowstation and facilities 
upgrade Integrity testing and inspection emergency response  to spill cases Surveillance by communities 
Awareness campaigns Improved interaction with communities and Presence of Joint Task Force JTF for 
efficient and effective spill management law enforcement

BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY 
Crude oil spill is the unintentional release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment as a result of 
human activity  The term often refers to marine oil spills where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters  
Most man made oil pollution comes from landbased activity 
Oil spillage occurs due to a number of causes which include the following corrosion of pipelines sabotage and 
oil production operations Sabotage and oil siphoning has become a major issue in the Niger Delta States as well 
contributing of further environmental degradation Anderson I 2005  Damaged lives may go unnoticed for 
days and repair of the damaged pipes take even longer  Oil siphoning has become a big business with the 
stolen oil quickly making its way into the black market Human Rights Watch 1999 
In late December 2006 more than 200 people were killed in the Lagos region of Nigeria in an oil line explosion 
CNN 2006 The 2006 explosion started after the oil line was tapped by people siphoning the oil with the 
intention of black marketresale CNN 2006 
Many factors – local currents weather water temperatures and the composition of the oil itself among others 
affect the degree of longterm environmental damage from big oil spills Maclean 1993  Heavy oil is more 
likely to be deposited on shorelines and can be extremely difficult to clean up if washed onto soft absorbent
sand Maclean 1993 Moreover heavy oils are largely insoluble forming coherentmasses which float on the 
surface or become stranded on the shore and can thus cause damage at a considerable distance from their point 
of release Nelson 1971  The heavy oil that eventually sinks can cover bottomdwelling species such as crabs 
with a thick film and damage feeding and breeding species 
Oil spillage is a major environmental problem associated with oil exploration and exploitation activities It has 
also caused regional crisis in the Niger Delta in onshore areas most pipelines and flow lines are laid above the 
ground  Pipelines which have an estimated life span of about 15years are old and susceptible to corrosion  
Many of the pipelines are as old as 20 – 25years Even Shell admits that “most of the facilities were constructed 
between the 1960s and early 1980s at the then prevailing standards” 
It is indeed a fact to state that the oil sector has immensely contributed to the general development of Nigeria 
This is evident in the heavy dependence of the economy on the oil sector which accounts for 90 – 95 of export 
revenue employment opportunities created provision of funds for takeoff of the other industries eg iron and

steel industries petrochemical and fertilizer industries and even the provision of various infrastructure in 
various parts of the country  
Despite the fact that the oil sector has contributed immensely to the development of the nation it should be 
emphasized that a lot of catastrophic damage has been done to the environment of the areas of production Oil 
spillage has a major impact on the ecosystem into which it is released  Immense tracts of the mangrove forests 
which are especially susceptible to oil have been destroyed  An estimated 5 – 10 of Nigeria’s mangrove 
ecosystem has been wiped out due to oil exploration  The rainforest which previously occupied some 
7400sqkm of land has disappeared as well 
Spills in populated areas often spread out over a wide area taking out crops and aquatic cultures through 
contamination of ground water and soils  In agricultural communities often a year’s supply of food can be 
destroyed by only a minor leak debilitating the farmers and their families who depend on the land for their 
livelihood  Drinking water is also frequently contaminated and sheets of oil is visible in many localized bodies 
of water  If the drinking water is contaminated even if no immediate health effects are apparent they 
contaminate coastal environmental leading to a decline in local fish production 
The oil industry has been accused of adding to the damage done to the environment by carbon dioxide emission 
which contributes to global climate change

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
Oil spill poses a major threat to the environment in Nigeria  If not checked or effectively managed it could lead 
to total annihilation of the ecosystem especially in the Niger Delta where oil spills have become prevalent  Life 
in this region is increasingly becoming unbearable due to the high effects of oil spills and many communities 
continue to groan under the degrading impacts of oil spills Oyem 2001 
The mangrove was once a source of both fuel wood for indigenous people and a habitat for the area’s 
biodiversity but now oil toxicity has depleted and devitalized the ecology Oil spill also has had adverse effect 
on marine life which has been contaminated in turn having negative consequences for human health from 
consuming contaminated seafood Farmlands and drinkable water are destroyed also and cause draw back in 
fishing of the coastal water Oil spills in the Niger Delta have been a regular occurrence and the resultant 
environmental degradation of the surrounding environment has caused significant tension among the people 
living in the region and the multinational oil companies operating there

AIM  
The aim of this study is to examine the pattern of oil spillage in Etche and the consequent impact on the 
environment

STUDY AREA 
Etche is the 4th largest ethnic group in the present day Rivers State Etche has two local government areas 
namely Etche Local Government Area and Omuma Local Government Area Etche occupies a land mass of 
about 1500sq km and has a population of about 600000 people Etche is bounded in the North by Imo State in 
the East by Abia State and Oyigbo in Rivers State in the West by Ikwere Local Government Area and in the 
South by Obio Akpor Local Government Area It lies on latitude 4030N and longitude 4035E of the Greenwich 
Meridian

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Mc Oliver 1984 noted that oil exploration has caused pollution and destroy many hectares of land in the oil 
producing areas Mashes which constitute an important component of river estuarine and coastal ecosystems 
are extremely sensitive to oil pollution Gundlach et al 1977 and can be severely damaged by spills which 
block carbon fixation by stifling plant transpiration and through this mechanism and others can kill marsh 
vegetation Pezeshki et al 2000

Fuel oil from spills has been known to persist for at least 5 years in marsh sediments from which it can be 
released into the marsh water This persistence is reflected by high hydrocarbon levels in shell fish inhabiting the 
polluted marsh or exposed to hydrocarbons released there from Burns and Teal 1979 Sanders et al 1980 
Maki 1991 Wade 1993 
Osuagwu 1984 examined the impact of petroleum activities on the agricultural sector and observed that 
although the oil boom attracted economic and political power to Nigeria it unfortunately led to environmental 
devastation socioeconomic deprivation and general under development of very oil producing communities 
Fishes may be exposed to spilled oil by direct contact In this case their gills might get contaminated or their 
eggs might absorb some components of oil They may also eat contaminated food without knowing it  Hence 
they may suffer changes in their heart and respiratory rate Some may even have enlarged livers reduced growth 
fin erosion a variety of biochemical and cellular changes and reproductive and behavioural responses 
Furthermore chronic exposure to certain chemicals found in the oil may cause genetic abnormalities or cancer in 
some species This will in turn affect humans Environmental and Science 2005 
Studies on crude oil spills from the Idoho production plat form to Mobil Qua Iboe Terminal in Akwa Ibom State 
showed that health conditions normally associated with oil operations like skin disorder like ashes corruptions 
and discharges were recorded and were linked with oil acne a kind of skin eruption resulting from exposure to 
crude oil Oil filed workers have been reported to have skin eruptions as a result of exposure to crude oil which 
also is seen among local fishermen who get in contact with incidences of major oil spill Other disease conditions 
like gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders were also linked to the oil spill  Their prevalence rates were 
slightly higher after the spill The poor seafood and water supply quality which were equally attributed to the oil 
spill also affected the health of the communities negatively Chinweze CU 2004 
Okpella in Nigeria Edo State suffered its second oil spill in three years when a pipeline belonging to the NNPC 
Nigerian National Petroleum Company a stated owned concern ruptured and spilled an as yet undermined 
amount of refined crude oil into the environment  The refined crude oil seeped into the underground water 
supply and then into a stream which provides the villages water Investigation reveals that more than 53 well in 
the town have been polluted as speck of refined crude float in the water Adetokumbo Abiola 2002 
Fishing the main livelihood of most residents has also failed to return to preoil spill levels even as fisher folks 
have resumed their fishing activities  Many affected residents especially in the worst affected areas have not 
recovered from the loss of their livelihood and income Nestor P B 2007  When oil spill occurs near the 
shore the whole adjoining district is invaded by nauseating pungent smell as air current carries volatile 
components far a filed  The risk of fire is high so that ships and boats mowed near the harbor are usually warned 
to leave Swimming and other recreational activities are suspended Okonkwo and Eboatu 1999 
Several studies documental cascades of events indirectly affecting individual survival or reproduction after sub 
lethal exposures Oil exposure resulted in lower growth rates reproductive impartment abnormal developments 
in fish a decline in mating and the appearance of smaller eggs in seabirds cascades of indirect effects were also 
present after the oil spill where indirect interaction lengthened the recovery process on rocky shorelines for a 
decades or more for example an initial loss of cover habitat led to losses of important grazers and promoted 
blooms of unwanted ephemeral green algae and opportunistic barnacles Peterson et al 2003 
Kalu 2000 reports that activities of oil exploration impact heavily on wildlife Reptiles such as crocodiles 
alligators and monkeys are driven from their natural habitats through noise of helicopters noise from explosive 
used for seismic surveys A number of them have been killed by pollution of water cricks and swamps due to 
contamination from oil spillage toxic waste dump He observes further that further growth in fish biomass in the 
Niger Delta is bleak as a result of the aggregate threat posed by oil spillage and habitat destruction Whatever 
affects fishery resources affects the economy of the rural communities of Niger Delta This is because fishing 
and farming is the major employment of a greater percentage of the region’s workforce Works of this nature has 
been mainly on regional level and as such this work is concentrating on only Etche community to reveal the 
expected micro impacts of oil exploration

DATA DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION  
Table 41 shows total number of oil spills in Etche Community between 2001 and 2007 A total of 29 spills were 
recorded with year 2001 recording six 6 spills while 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 had five 5 five 
5 five 5 two 2 two 2 four 4 respectively The year 2001 recorded the highest spills for the year under 
consideration while years 2005 and 2006 had the lowest spills 
Although the year 2003 had the highest quantity 41715 barrels of oil spilled within the seven years under 
consideration 01 and 05 barrels been the lowest spill occurred in the 2005and 2006 respectively A total 
quantity of 4270 barrels were spilled within the seven year period  On the average Etche has been witnessing 
four 4 spills per year with 610 barrels per year The year 2001 had 461 barrels spilled while the years 2002 
2003 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 had 12 barrels 41715 barrels 1283 barrels 01 barrel 05 barrel and 27 
barrels spilled respectively  On the causes of oil spill in Etche Community and four 4 major causes were 
observed They include sabotage pipeline equipment corrosion and others 
Sabotage caused 22 spills in Etche Community between 2001 and 2007 Pipeline equipment had a share of five 
5 incidents while corrosion and others had one 1 incident each  Sabotage had 759 of all the causes of oil 
spill in Etche Community while pipeline equipment corrosion and others shared 172 35 and 35 
respectively  The year 2001 and 2002 witnessed the highest sabotage with five 5 incidents each Corrosion and 
others recorded only one 1 incident each  The year 2003 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 had 3 4 1 2 and 2 spill 
incidents respectively Pipeline equipment – recorded one 1 incidents each in year 2001 2004 and 2007 
respectively  Corrosion incident and other causes occurred only once each within 2005 and 2007 respectively  
46 
DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS 
From tables 1 2 and 3 it was observed that about 29 oil spill incidents occurred between 2001 and 2007 in 
Etche Community leading to loss of about 4270 barrels of oil The outstanding cause of oil spill in Etche 
Community is sabotage Etche Community had 759 of oil spills due to sabotage either from the villagers or 
militants who may want to obtain favour from oil companies or many want to extort money from these 
companies  Only about 172 35 and 35 were caused by pipeline equipment corrosion and others too 
insignificant to classify 
From the questionnaire distributed the major impact of oil spill include destruction of farm land destruction of 
soil fauna and flora poisoning of both surface and underground water destruction of aquatic life and other

no single compensation has exceeded the sum of N20m twenty million This inadequate compensation and lack 
of social infrastructure has made life very unbearable for Etche people There is no access road no portable 
water and no electricity in most part of Etche Community

SUMMARY OF MAJOR FINDINGS 
The research treated “crude oil spillage in Etche Community Rivers State” The trust of the problem was on the 
impacts of oil spillage in Etche Community while the aim of the study was to examine the impacts of oil 
spillage on Etche Community between the 2001 and 2007 The objectives of the study include to examine the 
oil spillage in Etche and its environs to identify major sources and cause of oil spillage within the study area to 
evaluate the impact of oil spillage on the environment and recommend appropriate measures with a view to 
solving the problems of oil spillage in Etche  
Survey research design as well as interviews questionnaires and observation instruments were employed in data 
generation and collection Graphic illustrations and percentage analysis were also employed to describe the 
relative ratio of each factor to other factors  Result revealed that about 29 oil spill incidents occurred within the 
period under study 20012007 The volume of oil spilled cumulated to 4270 barrels with year 2003 having the 
highest 41715 barrels and year 2005 having the lowest 01 barrel   
Other years had their own shares as follows 2001 – 461 barrels 2002 – 12 barrels 2004 – 1283 barrels 2006 – 
05 barrels 2007 with 27 barrels The major causes of oil spill in Etche as identified include sabotage taken a 
lion share of 759 pipeline equipment 172 corrosion 35 and 35 for others too insignificant to 
categories  The outstanding impacts of oil spill in Etche include destruction of farmland pollution of surface 
and underground water systems elimination of sources of income destruction of soil flora and fauna as well as 
health impacts   
Recommendations were made on how to reduce oil spills in Etche Community And oil companies were urged to 
make concerted efforts to address legacy issues via poverty reduction good governance through strategic 
partnership and increased local content financial and technical support to Etche Community as well as 
employment to ensure sustainability of development

Remediation Techniques  
Various remediation options that have been selected and applied in the order of decreasing significance include 
• 
Remediation by enhanced natural attenuation 
 
Consisting of bioremediation and land farming RENA 
• 
Stabilization by cement fixation and  
• 
Low temperature thermal desorption unit LTDU 
Remediation of Past Impacted Areas 
All operational facilities and known past spill sites are being assessed using a Risk Based Corrective Action 
RBCA approach which evaluates risk by considering the potential sources pathways and receptors of 
hydrocarbon contamination
