Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Approximately 90 of Nigeria’s exports and 75 of the consolidated budgetary revenue comes from oil 
and gas the majority of which comes from the Niger Delta1 Consisting of nine states – Abia Akwa Ibom 
Cross Rivers Bayelsa Delta Edo Imo Ondo and Rivers – the Niger Delta is the third largest wetland in 
the world and has over 40 ethnicities and over 30 million people2 Shell Exxon Total and Eni aka Agip 
among others operate both onshore and offshore oil facilities in the Niger Delta with an estimated 372 
billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves as of January 20133
Against this massive wealth generation it has been estimated that the equivalent to the Exxon Valdez 
oil spill – a spill large enough to entirely change international practices relating to oil spill prevention and 
response – is spilled in the Niger Delta every year4 Where the Niger Delta remains the poorest region in 
Nigeria with over 70 of indigenes dependent on the natural environment for their livelihood environmental 
degradation due to oil spillage has increased joblessness extreme health problems and poverty5
Response to oil spills has been marked by corruption lack of effective communication power struggles 
and an almost total failure to adequately remedy oil spills by cleaning and restoring the environment and 
compensating those harmed Decades of this failed response have bred resentment and distrust among oil
affected communities increasing militancy and black market oil trade as a last resort path to wealthsharing 
and further complicating the possibility of a successful remediation and longterm peace6 Oil companies 
on the other hand report that they struggle with sabotage and theft of oil difficulties accessing spill sites 
and complicated community dynamics that contribute to spills and confuse and undermine remediation 
efforts7

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Against this backdrop this paper outlines the principles and practical considerations by which a grievance 
mechanism could be establish to handle and remedy complaints from communities and persons affected 
by oil spill in the Niger Delta The paper is informed by comparative research and the practical experiences 
of those who have – through negotiation litigation and other forms of recourse – sought remedy after an 
oil spill
Since the discovery of oil in 1956 Nigeria has put in place a number of government bodies laws and 
regulations to govern the extractive industry and its impacts including preventing and addressing oil spills 
There are dozens of laws regulations and policies pertaining directly to the extractive industry The most 
pertinent to oil spill are the Oil Pipelines Act OPA8 the Petroleum Act9 National Oil Spills Detection 
and Response Act and the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan NOSCP10 These laws and policies are 
understood with reference to legislation such as the Land Use Act11 and supplemented by the common law
Nigeria is party to several international instruments on oil spill compensation that deal with offshore spills 
from tankers however to date none have been domesticated12
 
1 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
The key government bodies mandated to regulate the oil industry and respond to oil spills are the Department 
of Petroleum Resources DPR the federal and state Ministries of Environment13 and the National Oil 
Spills Detection and Response Agency NOSDRA Where these institutions have often failed to provide 
adequate remedy aggrieved persons turn to the courts14 and direct negotiation In addition other state 
institutions at times intervene to resolve oil spill disputes despite the fact they are not mandated to do so 
One such example is the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC15
DPR was formed under the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and has the power inter alia to enforce 
general regulations for the petroleum sector including environmental standards and manage cleanup of 
oil spills In 1992 and 2002 DPR issued the nonbinding Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the 
Petroleum Industry in Nigeria EGASPIN which “forms the basis for most environmental regulation of the 
oil industry”16 DPR has significant enforcement powers including the ability to arrest any person who has 
committed an offence under the laws and regulations summoning oil companies to provide information 
suspending their operations and making regulations where needed17 The National Oil Spills Detection and 
Response Agency NOSDRA was created by statute and is mandated to prepare for detect and respond 
to “all oil spillages in Nigeria” form a National Control and Response Centre to monitor and receive reports 
of oil spill and coordinate responses and impose penalties for oil companies’ failure to report oil spills 
within 24 hours or clean up and remediate spill sites18 NOSDRA is also mandated to “assist in mediating 
between affected communities and the oil spiller”19

Box 1 Existing NonJudicial State Grievance Mechanisms in Nigeria
There are several nonjudicial or quasijudicial state grievance mechanisms in Nigeria which are 
a reference point for the proposals discussed below
These bodies include
• National Human Rights Commission established by statute in 1995 and in 2010 granted greater 
structural independence and powers among these powers is the mandate to receive and investigate 
complaints of human rights violations and issue binding decisions that are enforceable in the same 
way as decisions of the high court
• Public Complaints Commission established by statute in 1975 and mandated to receive and 
investigate complaints against public officers after investigation the PCC can refer matters for 
prosecution or disciplinary action as appropriate
• Police Services Commission established by the 1999 Constitution of the FRN and the Police 
Services Commission Establishment Act of 2001 the PSC receives complaints of police 
misconduct investigates and can take appropriate disciplinary action and
• National Committee on Torture established by the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation in line 
with the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture
 
2 LEGAL REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR COMPENSATION 
 
AND REMEDIATION OF OIL SPILLS
Beyond common law principles of liability20 several of the above listed laws establish rules relating to liability 
and compensation for harms arising from oil spills The most clearly applicable is the OPA which requires 
oil pipeline licensees to pay compensation in two oil spillrelated scenarios 1 for damages resulting from 
leakages or breakages in pipelines unless these are caused by the “malicious third party interference” 
and 2 for damages resulting from any neglect “to protect maintain or repair any work structure or thing 
executed under the licence” The latter provision clearly envisions the possibility of licensee liability for 
neglect to protect pipelines from malicious third party interference21 In addition
to these laws both government and industry bodies have attempted to establish standardized compensation 
rates that could be used for oil spills 22 See Annex A for details
For spills emanating from oil pipelines and ancillary installations the OPA seems to encourage affected 
persons and pipeline licensees to settle out of court however if the two sides are unable to settle on 
issues relating to damages the courts may decide23 According to the OPA aggrieved persons may 
additionally return to court to seek further damages if the initial award paid is not satisfactory or further 
harms result or presumably are later discovered The preference for settlement evidenced by the OPA’s 
complainantfriendly provisions is consistent with NOSDRA’s mandate to help mediate disputes
In 2000 the Petroleum Industry Bill PIB was introduced in the National Assembly for the first time after 
years of discussion the bill was reintroduced in 2012 The PIB would among other things put in place an 
environmental quality management plan which would require greater commitment by companies to remedy 
and control environmental degradation related to oil extraction and oil spills The PIB does not however 
set out a grievance mechanism or compensation and remediation scheme for oil spill related complaints 
even while it creates yet another regulatory body that appears to duplicate existing institutions 24
In light of the political impasse that has prevented enactment of such comprehensive oil sector legislation 
for nearly 15 years this paper attempts to propose practicable grievance redress mechanisms that could 
be put in place without new legislation or legislative reforms

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Despite the legal and institutional recognition that it is necessary to facilitate speedy compensation and 
remediation of harms resulting from oil production victims of oil spills in the Niger Delta continue to 
struggle to obtain adequate redress25 When oil spills occur the principle institutional response normally 
seen is a Joint Investigation Visit JIV that is meant to be conducted by the oil companies together with 
regulatory agencies including DPR NOSDRA and the federal or state Ministries of Environment and 
community representatives The resulting JIV report is presented by oil companies and regulatory agencies 
as a consensus position as to the cause of the spill and the scalescope of the spill but in reality is often 
discrediteddisavowed by affected communities and their representatives due to a failure to include and 
consult with genuine community representatives and oil company’s reported influence over regulatory 
agencies26
Cleanup and remediation which are supposed to occur immediately are often delayed and when they 
do occur employ less effective remediation techniques that do not reflect international best practices27 
Indeed Environmental Rights Action estimates that over 90 of spills in the Niger Delta have not been 
cleaned up28 This means environmental harms compound over time as some communities suffer repeated 
spills and ultimately have pushed entire communities eg Goi community to relocate in order to survive
Anecdotally negotiated compensation for affected persons suffers from lack of transparency and broad 
participation A few political elites may reap the benefits in the name of a community where the vast 
majorities never see any compensation Recourse through domestic courts is slow and plagued by delays 
due among other things to frivolous and repeated interlocutory appeals A recent trend has seen persons 
and communities affected by oil spills in the Niger Delta increasingly seeking remedy through foreign 
courts – namely the UK and Dutch courts – but this option may not be accessible to the vast majority of 
spillaffected communities or appropriate in the majority of smallerscale spills29
Annex B offers a few examples of outcomes resulting from individuals’ or communities’ quest for remedy In 
order to lay the ground for the issues to be addressed in designing a more effective grievance mechanism 
we categorize and elaborate these challenges below
Lack of awareness about processes and avenues for redress Currently oilaffected communities and 
individuals often do not know who to report a spill to and are confused about the process and what is 
required In a recent training of oilaffected communities from across four Niger Delta states for instance 
not one community leader was aware that NOSDRA had a mandate to mediate disputes between them and 
oil companies Such lack of awareness in turn breeds confusion distrust and misinformation30
Lack of broad participation and problems with community representation Too often community 
participation is treated as a mere token Communities are rarely consulted or given an opportunity to 
nominate their own participants in a JIV instead they report being chased away from ongoing JIVs by 
security and if they ever seen the resulting JIV report finding unknown or discredited persons signing 
as community representatives Research has also pointed out that postspill engagement between oil 
companies and communities has tended to include only elite men sidelining other key stakeholders31 Such 
practices facilitate elite capture of compensation if any is paid32 For instance after a 2004 spill that
affected the Goi community among others the JIV conducted by the oil company DPR Ministry of 
Environment included only one “community representative” and no one from the Goi community This lack 
of community participation led to significant disputes over the findings of the JIV33 Further women are 
almost completely excluded such investigations or negotiation processes meaning the gendered harms of 
oil spills tend to be ignored and unremedied34

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Lack of truly independent third party neutrals in mediation of disputes In practice DPR NNPC and 
other actors – such as oil company contractors operating on the ‘frontlines’ – often become involved in 
attempts to resolve compensation issues following an oil spill Although this process is sometimes labeled 
“mediation” these institutions have conflicts of interest due to financialstructural ties to the oil industry 
that make it difficult for them to act as truly unbiased uninterested third parties35 Further NOSDRA 
– officially mandated to investigate oil spills and mediate between companies and communities – is 
reportedly dependent on oil companies for resources to make a JIV possible thus allowing the oil company 
to dictate whetherwhen the JIV will occur scientific expertise and use of oil company facilities to run 
diagnostics on soil and water samples36 Affected communities report little engagement with NOSDRA 
when negotiating for compensation after a spill and distrust NOSDRA as an impartial third party to the JIV 
process37 Communities are also distrustful of attempts by these institutions to facilitate settlement based 
on their perceived alignment with oil companies corrupt politicians and community leaders38
Inadequate regulatory enforcement NOSDRA is also mandated to fine oil companies when they fail to 
report or cleanupremediate spills However though it has made efforts to assess and impose such fines in 
recent history it seems to lack the power to enforce these penalties much less any agreements that might 
be reached through its mediation efforts39
Lack of equal representation and independent expertise Current settlement processes are also marked 
by acute inequality of financial and technical resources between communities and oil companies Oil 
companies tend to have multiple lawyers and experienced negotiators whose sole job is to represent the 
oil companies’ best interests as well as technical experts and government contacts They also bring in 
their own scientific experts for the investigation and assessment Communities meanwhile have fewer 
resources to spend on experts and legal aid and may struggle to unite around one or two representatives 
where a community has diverse needs interests and internal politics40
Long delays in cleanup and remediation of the oil spill Response to oil spills by government institutions 
and oil companies and mitigation and initial cleanup of firstinstance harms caused by oil spills can take 
weeks or even months after a spill has been reported Remediation when done at all may also take months 
or even years due to a complicated matrix of interested parties working against each other and therefore 
against a successful and speedy outcome41 After suffering more than three major spills between 1997 
and 2009 the Goi community finally had no choice but to vacate – without any financial or resettlement 
assistance—after warnings from HYPREP about the longterm health consequences they would suffer due 
to soil and water contamination while various efforts to remedy have been ongoing since 1997 the first 
“pilot” cleanup exercise covering an area of just about three football fields only began in 201442
Focus on bunkering distracts from broader issues The current discussion on the causes of oil spills has been 
almost completely subsumed by a focus on bunkering distracting from the many other factors contributing 
to oils spills which include aging pipelines and poor maintenance Further the current discourse around 
bunkering fails to engage communities as active participants in mitigating the practice and rather holds 
communities generally complicit  without specific evidence  where bunkering may have caused an oil 
spill

Box 2 Access to remedy under the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights were produced by the Special Representative 
to the UN SecretaryGeneral on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises they were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 These 
principles help to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of States and corporations for 
respecting protecting and remedying when violated human rights The Guiding Principles 
provide direction to States and corporations on how to comply with their existing responsibilities 
under the international human rights system Since the Guiding Principles’ endorsement many 
state institutions and companies have taken steps to put these into practice
The Guiding Principles set out six principles see Section III on Access to Remedy for ensuring 
access to remedy through judicial or nonjudicial grievance redress mechanisms Although 
ultimately the responsibility of the State Principle 25 these Principles illustrate the role of 
corporations in helping to ensure access to effective remedy In short they outline principles for a 
variety of possible mechanisms
• Statebased judicial mechanisms Principle 26
• Statebased nonjudicial grievance mechanisms Principle 27 and
• NonStatebased grievance mechanisms Principles 28 and 30 on the role of States and industry 
associations in ensuring the availability of effective grievance mechanisms within a given industry 
and Principle 29 on operationallevel mechanisms established by businesses
Principle 31 establishes criteria for nonjudicial grievance mechanisms to be effective such
mechanisms must be legitimate accessible predictable equitable transparent rightscompatible
and a source of continuous learning additionally operationallevel mechanisms
should be based on engagement and dialogue

DESIGNING AN EFFECTIVE 
GRIEVANCE REDRESS 
MECHANISM FOR OIL SPILLS 
IN NIGERIA

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
As defined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights see Box 2 “The term grievance 
mechanism is used to indicate any routinized Statebased or nonStatebased judicial or nonjudicial process 
through which grievances concerning businessrelated human rights abuse can be raised and remedy can 
be sought” States companies and industry associations all have a role in ensuring or facilitating access 
to effective remedy when violations occur – which generally requires an effective grievance mechanism
Because of the difficulties with judicial recourse identified in the previous section this paper focuses on 
possible nonjudicial grievance redress options that could help to more effectively efficiently and fairly 
resolve complaints arising from oil spills in the Niger Delta Because of the problems observed with current 
bilateral negotiations or mediated settlements over oil spills seen above we strongly advocate for the 
establishment of a standing grievance mechanism rather than merely outlining alternative dispute resolution
techniques that can be explored and often are in lieu of or alongside litigation
Amongst standing nonjudicial grievance mechanisms there are many design considerations and specific 
practical questions to be addressed In this section we first outline a number of principles that should 
guide mechanism design We then explore key choices that must be made in setting up a mechanism 
including whether it is established by a single company called “operationallevel” or “internal” recourse 
by an industry association called private “external” or “third party” recourse or backed by government 
called statebased “third party” recourse as well as what kinds of powers it would have and how it would 
be funded Next we explore the different types of dispute resolution methods that the mechanism could 
employ and outline the possibility of a tiered or multichannel approach Finally we look at issues relating 
to available remedies and implementation of outcomes
 
1 PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE GRIEVANCE MECHANISM DESIGN
In order to ensure that a grievance mechanism is capable of delivering effective remedy there are certain 
core principles that will guide mechanism design so as to address many of the concerns or practical problems 
identified in current practice of oil spill dispute resolution in the Niger Delta The following principles are 
informed by various similar sets of principles for grievance mechanism design See Box 2
Awareness Lack of information or misinformation can breed distrust and uncertainty about which course 
of action to take and can be manipulated by interested parties seeking an advantage Therefore once a 
grievance mechanism is in place information about it should be widely shared – eg through SMS fliers 
signs posted in key locations eg every certain distance along pipelines community criers town hall 
meetings radio TV – to provide accurate information to affected communities broaden understanding 
and cooperation with the process and ensure greater accountability by and for all participants The initial
information should be sufficient to enable a wouldbe complainant to make contact with the mechanism 
Thereafter the mechanism must make sufficient information available to allow complainants to understand 
the steps and procedures that are to be followed For with the process and ensure greater accountability 
by and for all participants The initial information should be sufficient to enable a wouldbe complainant to 
make contact with the mechanism Thereafter the mechanism must make sufficient information available 
to allow complainants to understand the steps and procedures that are to be followed For instance rules 
of procedure should be written in simple terms published and provided to complainants up front
13
Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Participation After a spill full participation by all complainants and their representatives in all investigations 
and dialogues is essential Since oil spills tend to affect more than one person at a time – often a whole 
community or set of communities – lack of broad participation from across the affected class all too often 
undermines effective postspill recourse To avoid such issues an effective grievance mechanism must find 
ways to engage a broad and diverse set of members of an affected community Such engagement can also
ensure culturally sensitive and appropriate interaction The legitimacy of any party claiming to act in a 
representative capacity on behalf of a broader class of affected persons should be verified through public 
onsite community engagement Participation in alternative dispute resolution can ideally begin with pre
engagement that enables two parties to build a working relationship based on mutual information sharing 
and agreement upon remedies should a dispute arise43
Accessibility Complainants should be able to access and complain to the grievance mechanism directly 
through various channels eg in person by phone by SMS etc and without unduly burdensome 
formalities Once a complaint is commenced complainants should be provided clear written procedures 
see awareness above Where complicated and technical processes present barriers to access grievance 
mechanisms should provide neutral support to assist poor or vulnerable complainants to meet up with 
requirements – eg accessible language assisting illiterate or semiliterate complainants to reduce their
complaints to writing identify evidence they might collect to support their claim etc There must be a 
firewall between those persons providing assistance and the decisionmakers or neutral mediators And of 
course such assistance should never bar complainants from choosing their own external representatives 
or advocates As an example Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission NHRC can receive complaints 
in person by phone or in writing and certain staff are available to help reduce complaints to writing 
if necessary When conducting hearings complainants can bring a representative of their own choice 
represent themselves or apply to the NHRC for free legal representation
Structural Independence As discussed above too often the parties mediating the disputes relating to 
oil spills have strong ties to industry that may influence their ability to be independent or their perceived 
legitimacy Indeed this is a global issue—when BP set up a compensation fund under an “independent claims 
administrator” after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill affecting the US Gulf Coast the later discovery that 
the administrator Kenneth Feinman was being paid by BP undermined his legitimacy In Nigeria such 
concerns include the way oil companies pay the expenses for JIVs and influence the final JIV  issues 
around funding of the mechanism appointmentremoval of decisionmakers etc must be thought through 
carefully so as to safeguard the mechanism’s independence Although it is quite common for funding of 
a thirdparty grievance mechanism to come from the industry that benefits from its operation there are 
ways of structuring such funding to preserve independence – for instance statutory levies on companies 
using formula based partly on the company’s market share and partly on the number of spillscomplaints 
reported
Accountability There are several key ways to ensure the mechanism itself can be held accountable for 
operating as it is meant to operate First there must be published rules of procedure that include for 
instance timeframes for certain steps to take place once a complaint is submitted The mechanism must 
periodically publish data reporting on its compliance with these various requirements eg number of 
complaints received number found admissible average processing time number resolved satisfactorily 
etc Lastly there must be an independent body with oversight and review responsibilities For instance the
NHRC discussed above has published Standing Orders and Rules of Procedure and a Governing Council 
comprised of diverse stakeholders oversees its activities44 A key issue is to ensure the oversight body can 
also receivehandle complaints about any alleged mishandling of a complaint eg similar to the role of the 
Chief Judge in any federal or state high court if a presiding judge is alleged to lack requisite independence
impartiality
14
Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Transparency In relation to a grievance mechanism transparency operates at two levels 1 transparency 
throughout the process of handling the complaint for all parties involved and 2 transparency around the 
mechanism’s operations for a broader public see accountability Equal access to the same information by 
all parties to the complaints process is essential this includes transparency around compensation amounts 
to be paid to different persons or classes of persons whose complaints arise from the same event At 
times it may be appropriate to allow ongoing discussions under a mediation process or the outcome to 
be confidential as to nonparties however in this case confidentiality must be agreed to by all parties 
Transparency is especially important where it has historically been common for compensation to be 
unequal or inconsistent based more on one’s “ability to cough” than on application of a standard formula 
o demonstrated harms suffered45
Claimant choice In order to encourage claimants to pursue a nonjudicial alternative it is important that 
the mechanism’s procedures clearly guarantee that a claimant can at any point up until final settlement 
opt out of the mechanism and seek redress elsewhere Indeed some nonjudicial grievance mechanisms 
actually allow for the final outcome of the complaintshandling process whether through mediation or 
adjudication to only become binding on both parties if accepted by the complainant We note that such 
procedures – which are necessary to respect right to remedy and fair hearing guarantees – can impose 
difficulties on defendants especially where large numbers of complainants may not all agree and may 
ultimately follow different recourse paths However as most Nigerian courts are yet to adopt class action 
litigation rules it remains impossible to bind all members of a class and give defendants the kind of certainty 
they might wish for
Equity A grievance mechanism should work to equalize the power imbalances inherent to a dispute 
between an oil affected community and an oil company 
This includes
 
i Ensuring the right of both sides to independent advicesupport from any chosen
 
representatives without requiring those representatives be lawyers or otherwise
 
ii Ensuring procedures are aimed at achieving “substantial fairness” rather than
 
demanding compliance with unduly burdensome or technical procedures and
 
iii Continuing its role through the process of supervising implementation of any outcomes
 
Oilspill specific principles
Independent scientific expertise If technical disputes come up in the course of handling an oilspill related 
complaint the grievance mechanism must ensure that truly independent expertise is available to guide the 
process Except in rare circumstances where complainants have ways of accessing independent expertise 
to support their quest for remedy eg in the Bodo Community v Shell case 46 complainants and regulatory
agencies currently have to rely on expertise paid for by the oil company47 The importance of truly 
independent expertise is underscored by the widely reported unreliability of JIV reports under the current 
practice48 In the Bodo case for instance plaintiffs’ counsel illustrated the huge gap between the findings 
of the JIV conducted after the spill and those of the expert hired by the plaintiffs the first estimated 
4000 barrels spilled while the second estimated 500000 spilled the first estimated 36 hectares of 
mangrove affected while the second estimated over 1000 hectares affected49 Because of such huge gaps 
in the findings of scientific experts in adversarial proceedings it is essential—and more efficient—for the 
mechanism to find some way of bringing in independent expertise if a dispute arises between the parties 
as to the scopescale of the spill and its impacts etc50
15
Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
Prioritization of mitigation and cleanup The biggest tragedy of the systemic failure of mechanisms 
meant to respond to oil spill in the Niger Delta is the compounding of environmental harm and related 
consequences for health livelihoods and community way of life An effective grievance mechanism should 
prioritize addressing environmental impacts immediately after an oil spill in line with EGASPIN It should be 
made clear from the outset of any engagement that immediateearly efforts to mitigate harm and cleanup 
environmental impacts even if aspects of liability are disputed will be factored in to offset compensation 
awards Cleanup efforts could also include the community thereby making it more participatory inclusive 
and transparent and could thereby improve relations toward early amicable settlement
Equitable apportionment of liability The current discourse around the causes of oil spills tends to look at 
bunkeringsabotage simply as a defense against oil company liability however the OPA clearly provides 
that the company can still be liable at least partially if it neglects to protect maintain or repair pipelines 
even if they are affected by malicious third party interference The grievance mechanism must therefore be 
able to take into account submissions from all parties as to not only the cause of the spill but also possible
negligence – by the oil pipeline licensee as well as by government security forces who are meant to lead 
pipeline security If there are allegations of complicity in bunkering or sabotage by members of the affected 
community these should be specific and proven including by way of evidence that might have resulted 
from a police investigation if any The resulting settlement could thus point to other parties who should be 
partially liable if the liability of the pipeline operator has been reduced or waived under the circumstances
 
2 SETTING UP THE MECHANISM
Nonjudicial grievance mechanisms can take many forms which sometimes but not always correspond 
to different names including “ombudsman” “complaints commission” “mediator” etc Underlying these 
differences are key decisions often dependent on real world factors rather than best case scenarios as 
to where the mechanism derives its authority what powers it has to fulfill its mandate and wherehow it 
is funded
While in many situations it makes sense for companies to have operationallevel grievance mechanisms 
aka internal recourse mechanisms – and oil companies should have these to handle the numerous other 
complaints that might arise in the course of doing business – we strongly recommend that all oil spill
related complaints should pass through a single thirdparty mechanism Such a single entrypoint across 
the industry will equally assist compliance with existing regulatory requirements since companies must 
already report all spills to NOSDRA within 24 hours – a practice that recent statistics indicate have been 
inconsistent51 Even if certain complaints – eg those relating to Tier 1 spills – are referred back to the 
company’s internal grievance mechanism to allow swifter resolution this should then only occur after initial 
investigation has been done to correctly assess the scopescale of the spill and ensure that complainants 
are given consistent information and an overview of their options etc
Thirdparty mechanisms are normally established either by government or else by an industry association 
for its member companies sometimes called a “voluntary” mechanism The authority powers and 
sources of funding for the mechanism are determined then by the government or the industry association 
Governmentbacked mechanisms generally have an enabling statute that helps to establish them with 
further details worked out through subsidiary legislation Industrybacked mechanisms are established by 
a decision of an industry association occasionally in compliance with a regulatory requirement and can
either be situated within the association with certain firewalls or established separately
16
Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
In the Nigerian context for instance a government body such as NOSDRA could under its existing 
statutory mandate establish a department specifically set up to mediate oil spillrelated disputes between 
oil companies and communities Without new legislation or an amendment to NOSDRA’s statute however 
it would have somewhat limited powers – that is it would not have the power to issue binding decisions 
unless they were agreed by all parties nor would it have the powers to summon said parties or compel 
evidence and so on However there are many examples from other countries where regulatory bodies use
other tactics – known as “moral suasion” – in lieu of formal enforcement powers Indeed a strong and 
sincere governmentbacked intermediary that takes time to hear bothall sides build trust and ensure fair 
outcomes to challenging disputes may be even more effective than one that relies solely on enforcement 
powers52
Alternatively an industry body such as the Oil Producers Trade Section of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce 
OPTS could determine that it wanted to provide a mechanism for resolving oil spillrelated disputes 
between communities and its members In various countries industry associations have taken this step 
when there is a strong business incentive—often industrywide reputational risk that needs to be addressed 
for the benefit of all members For instance after a series of crises in the microfinance industry in Pakistan
involving suicides among overindebted borrowers that began to threaten investment in the sector the 
Pakistan Microfinance Network proactively put in place an industrywide complaints handling mechanism 
covering all of its members
If new legislation were possible rather than solely building on existing institutions and mandates then a 
wider array of options could be considered A NOSDRA Amendment Act could give the Agency a mandate 
to set up a more formal grievance mechanism and broader powers eg to adjudicate summon witnesses 
compel evidence and enforce decisions53 Alternatively legislation could compel the relevant industry 
body to set up its own voluntary grievance mechanism that complies with the fundamental principles set 
outabove54
In any of the above new arrangements it is essential to ensure sufficient resources to enable a mechanism 
to fulfill its mandate but in such a way as to ensure its independence In various countries thirdparty 
grievance mechanisms – both statutory and voluntary – are funded through levies on the industry The key 
to independence is for these levies to be mandatory not voluntary and based on a formula that is fair and 
divorced from the handling of a specific case For instance a government mediator in Armenia is funded
through statutorily imposed levies based on market share of each industry player In the UK annual fees to 
support an ombudsman are based partially on market share and partially on the number of complaints that 
come against any particular industry player No matter the formula it can either be imposed by legislation 
or a levy on industry association members
Box 3 Tier 1 Tier 2 and Tier 3 Oil Spills
In the 1980s the oil industry developed a system to categorize oil spills to facilitate response planning 
known as Tiered Preparedness and Response The Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness
Response and Cooperation uses these same three tiers in provision on how signatory states should
ensure rapid response to oil spills The system is summarized as follows
“Tier 1 spills are operational in nature occurring at or near an operator’s own facilities as a 
consequence of its own activities The individual operator is expected to respond with their own 
resources Tier 2 spills are most likely to extend outside the remit of the Tier 1 response area and 
possibly be larger in size where additional resources are needed from a variety of potential sources
and a broader range of stakeholders may be involved in the response Tier 3 spills are those that 
due to their scale and likelihood to cause major impacts call for substantial further resources from 
a range of national and international sources” – Guide to Tier Preparedness Response International

3 GRIEVANCE PROCESSING METHODSOPTIONS
Closely interrelated with the issues of how a mechanism is established where it derives its authority and 
what powers it has is the question of what methods it employs to resolve disputes Under the current 
legislative and regulatory regime see above the only method that a grievance mechanism could employ 
is mediation However this can be modified by agreement or by broader legislative changes 55
Because of the balancing of different factors that is inherent in the choice of nonjudicial recourse – cost 
efficiency speed substantial fairness prioritization of issues such as cleanupmitigation of damages etc 
– and the value of having all oil spill complaints channeled through the same mechanism a multitrack 
methods approach might be ideal56 Such an approach could help also to ensure that a single mechanism 
would be able to facilitate response to the broader environmental impact of the spill as well as address 
immediate and longterm injuries to the complainant One way of channeling complaints into different 
tracks would be based on the level and gravity of the spill the immediate and longterm impacts on 
environment and health and accordingly the appropriate remedy
Different tracks for Tier 1 Tier 2 and Tier 3 Once the gravity and extent of the spill has been determined it 
can be classified as Tier 1 2 or 3 see Box 3 which can in turn dictate which approaches complaints relating 
to the spill canshould be channeled through It should also help to set out time frames for environmental 
cleanup and how severe the longterm impacts will be on the environment and the neighbouring communities 
Different methods may apply for different tiers For instance a Tier 1 spill may only affect a small number 
of people and have localized less significant environmental impacts In this instance a quick transparent 
cleanup and payout scheme may be appropriate However the impacts of a Tier 3 oil spill may not be 
understood for quite some time and could affect thousands of people across a very large area Clean 
up and the long term impacts of the oil spill will delay full remedy and this requires a more contextual 
approach see Remedy
Methods There are many different methods for handling complaints These may include quick payouts 
generally used for Tier 1 spills or as an interim measure to help offset the harm caused by loss of income food 
or water sources negotiation usually a first step facilitated or observed by the grievance mechanism 
mediation the grievance mechanism acts as the neutral third party who facilitates the negotiation between 
the two sides and helps them to reach a voluntary agreement arbitration unlike mediation both parties
agree to abide by a decision given by the grievance mechanism prior to the start of arbitration and 
adjudication more like a court process adjudication can involve a committee or tribunal formed of experts 
in the field who review evidence in accord with the evidentiary rules of procedure as well as precedent on 
this matter and issue a final binding decision As argued above the grievance mechanism should have a 
single entry point for all complainants to enable equal treatment and adequate preliminary investigation 
but then could recommend different tracks for different complaints as appropriate It could look something 
like

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
 
4 REMEDIES AND IMPLEMENTATION
Remedy should be both procedural and substantive This means that it should be both free of corruption 
and political influence and it should generally aim to counteract or make good any injuries that have 
occurred “Remedy may include apologies restitution rehabilitation financial or nonfiscal compensation 
and punitive sanctions whether criminal or administrative such as finds as well as the prevention of harm 
through for example injunctions or guarantees of nonrepetition”57 Effective remedy must be transparent 
and include community participation Finally the grievance mechanism must provide oversight
and if necessary enforcement of the agreed remedy
Range of remedy options – cleanupremediation compensation for irreparable harms suffered 
alternative community remedies All forms of remedy must include consultation and input by the intended 
beneficiaryies This includes the participation of affected communities in the cleanup and remediation 
of the oil spill as well as their active participation in determining which forms of remedy would be 
most appropriate Remedy can be and often tends to be monetary However damages can be drastically 
reduced by returning the injured party to the place they were prior to the harm – thus if it is impossible to 
return the affected environment to its prior state or an adequate state of healthy environment remedies 
could include resettlement to a satisfactory alternative location Where remediation is closely linked to 
remedy remedy should not be finalized and concluded until after remediation itself has also been finalized 
and found satisfactory by the regulatory bodies Thus remedy should also include an understanding of the 
level of the spill – Tier 1 Tier 2 or Tier 3  and the time frame for the clean up For instance while immediate 
remedy might be appropriate for a Tier 1 spill that is contained and cleaned immediately with few and 
foreseeable side effects in the case of a Tier 3 spill remedy is most appropriate after comprehensive 
cleanup and restoration has begun and may require immediate based on mitigating the immediate harms 
of loss of farm land community etc midterm compensating lost employment providing alternatives 
such as training and participation in the clean up and temporary resettlement and longterm restoration 
of the land to its initial state rebuildingresettlement of communities or full compensation for the loss 
thereof remedies
Transparency and community participation in implementation Remedy is not only about the award itself 
but also about the injured party’s experience of a satisfactory outcome that allows himher to feel like 
their injury was fairly addressed The long history of distrust between communities and oil companies 
in the Niger Delta makes transparency and complainant participation in the implementation especially 
important to this second element of remedy Oil companies occasionally accuse communities of 
stopping their environmental cleanupremediation attempts unless there are shortterm gains Therefore 
community consultation participation and understanding of the importance of harm mitigation cleanup 
and remediation activities is essential Further participation and transparency helps communities to 
form realistic goals for compensation and allows companies to understand alternative remedies such 
as employment and educational opportunities that may be accepted in lieu of cash payments Remedy 
should respond to the longterm foreseeable harms and should cover the totality of injury – health risks 
loss of communityeducationincome as well as loss of crops or land Regardless the best remedy is the 
one that is accepted and agreed to by the recipients
Enforcementoversight of implementation – role of grievance mechanism continues through implementation 
phase A grievance mechanism must be able to oversee and enforce any remedy agreement All too often 
remedy has been awarded to oilaffected communities with no enforcement This is especially so in the 
case of environmental cleanup where an estimated 90 of oil spills in the Niger Delta have not been 
cleaned

Oil Spills In the Niger Delta Remedy and Recovery
To date no standing mechanism has been able to offer fair and effective alternative dispute resolution 
in the context of Niger Delta oil spills Litigation is often inappropriate to the scale and urgency of spill 
remediation and compensation government bodies meant to help facilitate efficient response lack the 
requisite independence and enforcement powers and negotiated settlements between companies and 
communities tend not to fairly compensate harms suffered address ongoingfuture harms or reach all 
affected persons often suffering from elite capture Meanwhile there is strong evidence that most spills 
are not cleaned up while the environmental consequences continue to undermine health and livelihoods 
Against this background an effective grievance mechanism is urgently needed

14 Oil spill related disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal high courts in Nigeria see section 2511n of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria although victims have increasinglybeen exploring litigation before foreign jurisdictions
15 The NNPC is a stateowned enterprise that holds national shares of in the oil industry and negotiates contracts with international and domestic oil companies The majority 
of these contracts are either joint venture generally used for onshore extraction in which the NNPC holds majority shares or production sharing contracts generally used 
for offshore extraction in which the terms vary NNPC is occasionally called on to mediate oil spill disputes this practice is however problematic in light of its interest in 
the outcome and not part of the NNPC’s statutory mandate responding to oil spills rather falls within the purview of DPR and NOSDRA EIA Report note 3 Discussions with 
individuals who engage with and who are from oil affected companies revealed that NNPC sometimes joins in the negotiation process

with at least a few thousand plaintiffs in order to achieve an economy of scale that justifies the expense of such sophisticated litigation

41 Community livelihoods and environment are not the only areas impacted by delays – traditional social and cultural practices are also severely impacted by long delays in 
cleanup Oil companies government actors and communities all complicate attempts to remediate and redress the injured parties This includes oil companies using delay 
tactics in the courts government actors failing to impose or enforce penalties on regulation and remediation violations and communities refusing access to oil spill areas unless

Information see note 25
52 Examples of this come from Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission that has started under its strengthened mandate see Box 1 to hold series of public inquiries 
of various human rights issues of national concern Along with adjudicating individual cases the NHRC has offered through these hearings to mediate certain disputes where 
bothall sides are willing In other country contexts a newly introduced industry mediator in Senegal has used his office to go to different farflung communities convene a 
townhall meeting with industry in that area local authorities and ordinary citizens and explain the role he could play as a mediator explain how complaints are brought and 
listen to all sides on the general issues encountered in that area This builds understanding and trust in the fairness of his judgments
53 An amendment could expand NOSDRA’s current mandate to mediate between parties over oil spillrelated disputes for instance giving it the ability to have a multichannel 
approach see below Some of the requisite powers to enable NOSDRA to fulfill its mandate could be modeled on the NHRC Amendment Act 2010 Such a change might 
require that provisions of the OPA that envision only judicial recourse options be amended
54 This is a middle ground approach that has been used in South Africa where industry ombudsmen are a common way to approach thirdparty recourse certain industries are 
required to either set up a voluntary scheme for resolution of disputes or else complaints go to a governmentbacked statutory ombudsman
55 Agreement includes voluntary agreement among members of an industry association or between parties to a dispute to submit to a binding nonjudicial outcome 
eg arbitration
56 Alternative dispute mechanisms have traditionally been the forms through which issues are resolved in many Nigerian communities However many traditional formats 
are changing under globalization and changing interpretations of culture A multitrack approach can therefore combine different bestpractice to address these areas Bolaji
