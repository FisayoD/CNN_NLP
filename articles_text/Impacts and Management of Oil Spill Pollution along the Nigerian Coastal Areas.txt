Introduction
Fresh water is a resource that sustains the lives live
lihoods existence of humans and the biodiversity of 
an environment Fortunately Nigeria is blessed with 
rich inland freshwater resources and these resources 
are serving the human population providing drinking 
water irrigation for farming and fishing Therefore 
the management system of Nigeria‘s water resources 
must be efficient and of the highest standard requi
red to maintain the quality that can sustain organisms 
with the rivers as their habitat and the people who 
rely on the water resources for their livelihood Gi
ven the importance of freshwater as a source of sus
tenance for the millions of people it serves in Nigeria 
its depletion contamination or pollution will mean 
sentencing the organisms and people that depend on 
this resource to a life of almost irreversible destitu
tion
The pollution of fresh water at any point is causing 
the presence of a substance or certain conditions to 
such an extent that it makes the water unsuitable for 
specific purposes1 The source of pollution can be 
pointsource or nonpointsource2 Point sources 
are identifiable points or places that could be pipes 
or channels that discharge into a water drain The di
scharge could be from wastewater treatment plants 
factories industrial plants latrines septic tanks 
etc Nonpoint sources are those sources from where 
pollution arises and spreads over a wider area thus 
making it challenging to locate the exact place of ori
gin For example fertilisers or pesticides drain from 
a farm into a river or stream through several surfaces 
or soil locations
Oil exploration and exploitation operations have 
been identified as the top major polluter of freshwa
ter channels globally3 Nigeria is rich in both fresh
water resources and petroleum resources But the 
management of both resources is trapped in a cons
titutional confluence that has caused the environ
ment and the people the pain of being left to grapple 
with the devastating effect of water pollution Under 
the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
CFRN 1999 petroleum and water resources are 
under the federal government‘s control The federal 
government is not effectively performing this consti
tutional role due to a weak regulatory framework and 
lack of political will to initiate amendments that will 
Impacts of Oil Production on Nigeria‘s 
Waters Assessing the Legal Labyrinth
Solomon A Ienlanye Dennis Agelebe
Freshwater pollution contaminates substances that render the water body in certain areas of Nigeria unsuitable for 
specific usage Two fundamental causative agents of water pollution are oil exploration and exploitation operations 
Consequently environmental pollution from oil production in Nigeria has detrimental impacts on freshwater bodies 
particularly for communities located in oilbearing regions The resultant pollution has significantly affected the lives 
and livelihoods both economically and socially of these communities In response to these environmental hazards  the 
Federal Government of Nigeria has established legislation to protect the environment against oil pollution The Natio
nal Water Resources Bill has generated controversy in that it seeks to determine the clamour for the devolution of pow
er among the tiers of government to actualise true federalism in Nigeria This paper articulates the inadequacies in the 
regulatory framework for the administration of freshwater as established in the Constitution of the Federal Republic 
of Nigeria 1999 as amended Further the paper examines the effectiveness of the relevant environmental protection 
enactments in implementation enforcement and monitoring by the responsible governmental agencies The impacts 
of oil production on the biodiversity in Nigeria are also evaluated to provide recommendations for strengthening the 
regulatory structure for the management of freshwater to ensure minimal oil pollution

give component states the powers to manage neces
sary activities connected to the use and maintenance 
of water resources 
This paper examines the weakness in the regulatory 
structure for the management of freshwater as pro
vided in the constitution and how the federal system 
as practised in Nigeria is not clear on the role of the 
state governments in managing fresh water and water 
channels A qualitative desk research was conduc
ted by studying public documents research articles 
laws and records that provides information on the 
historical background of water resource and land 
management from preindependece era to present 
fourth republic despensation This method helped 
us to appreciate the political argument as different 
from the legal imperatives that underpins the consti
tutional isues related to water resource management 
in a federal system Also the institutional structure 
for water resource management at different levels 
of government is reviewed to make us understan
ding the areas of conflicts and duplication of roles 
The above helped us identify the tilting slop towards 
federal system of overseeing water water resources 
while maintaining a quasiunitary system for natural 
resource management as responsible for the constant 
misunderstanding between the federal government 
and the subnationals on specific roles regarding the 
regulation and protection of water resources 
Furthermore the paper reviews the federal structure 
of the division of powers in the CFRN to understand 
how the structure affects the regulatory control of 
the exploitation of natural resources and associated 
activities that results in the pollution of Nigeria‘s in
land waters and wetlands An exploratory method of 
describing the federal features in the Nigerian Cons
titution is adopted to achieve this Critical analysis is 
made of the system presented in the constitution in 
light of relevant judicial decisions and some existing 
scholarly academic perspectives This descriptive 
and analytical overview of Nigeria‘s federalism lays 
the foundation for the sectorial study of the oil indus
try the laws regulating the operators in the industry 
under the exclusive authority of the federal govern
ment and the laws of component states that should 
represent shared or concurrent regulatory responsi
bility for their operations in the Federation‘s inland 
waterways
Legal Issues in the Constitutional Management 
of Water Resources in Nigeria
Background
In 2017 the Executive arm of the Federal Govern
ment of Nigeria FGN sponsored a bill to the Natio
nal Assembly to transfer the ownership and control of 
water resources including surface and underground 
waterways from states to the Federal Government 
However the National Water Resources Bill suffe
red a setback because of the controversy it generated 
and the opposition from state governments Notwith
standing the rejection of the Bill in the 8th National 
Assembly the National Water Resources Bill was 
reintroduced in the 9th National Assembly sometime 
in 2020 By the provisions of this Bill the Federal 
Government will take over the control of water re
sources from the states license the supply and com
mercialise water utilisation in Nigeria 4
Essentially the National Water Resources Bill ex
clusively vests on the Minister of Water Resources 
the power to formulate water resources management 
strategy to guide integrated planning management 
use and conservation of the nation‘s water resources 
and provide guidance for the formulation of hydro
logical area resources strategies 5 
The Bill further regulates protects conserves and 
controls water resources identified by the Bill as wa
ter resources crossing state boundaries for equitable 
and sustainable social and economic development 
and maintaining the environment‘s integrity 6 Ul
timately the proposed legislation seeks to enact an 
Act that would provide a regulatory framework for 
Nigeria‘s water resources sector 78   The oppo
sition to the Bill is not unconnected with its seeming 
negation of true federalism and the constitutionality 
question of its practical implementation
Nigerian Oil Industry and its Contribution to 
Water Pollution
Since the discovery of crude oil in 1956 by the 
Royal Dutch Shell Group the Oil industry has been 
growing in operators and operations The industry 
has three sectors of operations the downstream sec
tor the upstream sector and the service sector The 
downstream sector engages operators dealing in re
fining and marketing refined products in bulk and 
retail the upstream sector is where operators carry 
out exploration and transportation activities domina
ted by multinational oil companies MOCs At the 
same time the service sector comprises companies 
that provide support services to the downstream and 
upstream sectors 
The upstream sector is the most active in the Nige
rian economy accounting for about 90 of national 
export and 80 of the Federation‘s revenue Given 
the strategic economic importance of this sector to 
the country legal and environmental experts have ad
judged regulatory control of the sector‘s operations 
as weak and below international standards 9 Over 
the decades of oil exploration and exploitation in Ni
geria particularly the Niger Delta region the MOCs 
and their national collaborators have conducted their 
operations in disregard for environmental standards 
thereby causing almost irreversible disastrous im
pacts on the environment in the area The Niger Del
ta is the largest wetland in Africa and among the ten 
most important wetland and marine ecosystems glo
bally consisting of diverse ecosystems of freshwater 
swamps rain forests and mangrove swamps But the

operation of MOCs and local oil companies LOCs 
has caused oil pollution that has contaminated stre
ams and rivers destroyed forests and farmlands and 
turned the area into an ecological wasteland10
Oil exploration activities by MOCs and LOCs in
volve engineering and geological operations that af
fect the aquatic environment For exploitation pipe
lines have been laid covering over 7000 km across 
different operational areas of the country 11 These 
pipelines run across mangroves rivers and farm
lands with incidences of oil leakages resulting in 
devastating environmental pollution While the oil 
companies usually blame acts of vandalism for the 
incidence of petroleum leakages affected communi
ties and experts have strongly argued that these inci
dences are due to weak pipeline integrity 
Over the past decades of oil exploitation in Nige
ria oil spills have been identified as one of the major 
causes of environmental pollution and hazards pla
guing people living in oilbearing regions and even 
communities that host oil facilities but do not hold 
any hydrocarbon resources 12 Apart from acciden
tal industrial discharges or leakages the reoccurring 
oil spills result from years of neglect of oil pipe
lines without routine cheques and maintenance and 
changes in old and wornout pipelines among other 
factors Oil pipelines in Nigeria are prone to natural 
ruptures due to a lack of proper maintenance practice 
and schedule 13 The system that should look after 
the appropriate maintenance of the pipelines has not 
been functional due to weak or almost nonexistent 
regulatory oversight by the concerned government 
agencies
Since 1979 when the Forcados tank 6 Terminal in 
Delta State spilt about 570000 barrels of oil into the 
Forcados estuary14 causing pollution of the aquatic 
environment and neighbouring rivers the oil indus
try has been recording the incidence of oil spillages 
that have adversely affected the wellbeing of people 
of the affected areas According to a statement made 
by the Nigerian Minister of Environment 4919 
oil spills were recorded between 2015 and March 
202115 With over 400000 barrels per daybpd of 
oil spilt The environmental implication is colossal 
and devastating for present and future generations 
Oilbearing communities have altered their economic 
and social wellbeing due to water pollution caused 
by oilproducing companies‘ exploration and exploi
tation activities Most of these communities depend 
on fishing and farming for their daily sustenance 
With the pollution of their waters their sources of li
velihood have been adversely affected and their lives 
are thrown into a state of stagnation desperation and 
frustration While in theory the people affected can 
sue the MOCs and the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
for violating their right to a healthy and clean envi
ronment the legal and financial hurdles often appear 
too daunting for them to do so There is also a lack 
of confidence in the judicial system of Nigeria The 
example of Nigerian claimants filing lawsuits over
seas against multinational oil companies operating 
in the Niger Delta region for damage caused by oil 
spills proves this point The Netherlands and the Uni
ted Kingdom are home to three such lawsuits filed 
against Royal Dutch Company the parent company 
of Shell Petroleum Company  Four farmers filed 
three claims against Royal Dutch Shell in 2008 in a 
district in the Hague Netherlands seeking reparati
ons for damages caused by spills from pipelines ope
rated by the subsidiary company in the Niger Delta 
Nigeria 16 The communities of Ogale and Bille 
filed a lawsuit against Royal Dutch Shell and Shell 
Petroleum Company in the United Kingdom in 2015 
for damages caused by oil leaks from pipelines ow
ned by the respondents 17 An oil spill caused by 
the Shell spill in 2008 polluted the river and farm
lands of the Bodo community in Nigeria In 2014 
they sued Shell in the United Kingdom for the dama
ge The same year the company settled out of court 
and paid fiftyfive million pounds to the claimants 
as compensation 18 However there are instances 
where the court by its decision has recognised the 
people‘s right to a healthy and clean environment 
and the duty of the government to ensure the MOCs 
adhere to regulations and practices that will prevent 
further pollution of the environment
In SERAP v the Federal Republic of Nigeria 19 
the SocioEconomic Rights and Accountability Pro
ject SERAP sued as Plaintiff They argued that the 
inability of the Nigerian government to enforce extant 
environmental enactments and corresponding regula
tions to protect the environment is tantamount to the 
violation of the right of health and clean environment 
of the Niger Delta people as guaranteed by the Inter
national Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural 
Rights ICESCR and the Africa Charter on Human 
and Peoples‘ Rights In consequence the court held 
that the failure of the Nigerian government to mo
nitor and enforce environmental legislation violated 
the rights to health and a healthy environment accor
ding to Articles 1 and 24 of the African Charter Con
sequently the court ordered the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria to effect speedy measures to restore the Niger 
Delta environment The court further stated that Ni
geria must adopt the necessary mechanism to fores
tall a repeat of such environmental pollution resulting 
from oil production It is noteworthy that this matter 
was decided by the Economic Community of West 
African States ECOWAS Court and not any of the 
Courts within the jurisdiction of Nigeria As this pa
per illustrates the extraterritorial proceedings com
menced in national and regional courts have shown 
the difficulty of instituting legal proceedings against 
MOCs in Nigerian courts for the communities affec
ted by the oil spill Since the return of democracy 
in 1999 several legal and institutional changes have 
been established to regulate the oil industry These 
changes starting with the 1999 constitution have

farreaching implications for regulating and mana
ging water resources against oil spillage and respon
ding to oil spillage that pollutes the same The 1999 
Constitution vests the regulation and granting of a 
permit for oil exploration and exploitation exclusive
ly in the federal government20 On the premise of 
this constitutional provision the federal government 
has established institutional structures regulations 
and laws for the oil industry However the effective
ness of the legal and institutional machinery has been 
adjudged by scholars experts activists and people 
living in communities being affected by the activities 
of MOCs as poor and almost of no effect21
Overview of Nigeria‘s Federal System
Nigeria‘s history as a country with a federal system 
of government dates back to its adoption in the 1954 
Constitution when the  Eastern Northern and Wes
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123

tern regions were granted semiautonomous status 
thus allowing them to be selfgoverned The same 
system was retained in the independence constitu
tion of 1960 the republican Constitution of 1963 the 
presidential Constitution of 1979 the revised Cons
titution of 1989 and the current presidential Cons
titution of 1999 The basic definition of federalism 
posits a system that shares a constitutional alliance 
between individual component states in a group to 
form a national state where a central authority will 
share statutory powers and functions with the com
ponent states22 Wheare‘s23  description of Fe
deralism or Federal principles indicates a division of 
constitutional powers to legislate in a Federal struc
ture between a central government and subnational 
governments in a way that clearly defines the statut
ory legislative ambit of each side without overlap
ping each other‘s legislative authority In the case of 
Nigeria the federal system reflects the list of powers 
that the constitution allots exclusively to the federal 
government and the powers that the Federal and State 
governments exercise concurrently This fits well 
with Appadorai‘s definition of a federal state
a federal state is one in which there is a cen
tral authority that represents the whole and 
acts on behalf of the whole in external affairs 
and in such internal affairs as are held to be of 
common interest and in which there are also 
provincial or state authorities with powers of 
legislation and administration within the sphe
res allotted to them by the constitution 24
The question of exclusivity in Nigeria‘s federal sys
tem is often questioned along the lines of what po
litical and structural justification matches Nigeria‘s 
peculiar ethnic and geopolitical configuration In the 
past two decades the concurrency of states‘ powers 
and the federal government has been a subject of 
fractious legal arguments and litigations Given the 
fluidity of shared constitutional responsibilities and 
liabilities of the federal and state governments as 
structured in the Constitution of the Federal Republic 
of Nigeria 1999CFRN   conflicts in the applica
tion and interpretation of constitutional provisions 
are inevitable 
Given the peculiar political ideology that accentua
tes the primacy of the federal government as supreme 
in relation to parts of the Federation it is pertinent 
that this study stresses the relevancy of the partial au
tonomy of states visàvis the legal clog that automa
tically overrides the executory or regulatory powers 
of states to protect the environment from pollution by 
the activities of operators in the oil industry
Nature and Features of Nigeria‘s Federalism
The 1999 Constitution of Nigeria reflects the basic 
features of a typical federal system However in 
practice legal scholars and experts view Nigeria as 
not practising what they call „true federalism25“  
According to Okpereva Nigeria has practised its 
federal system awkwardly which has prompted 
questions about whether it is a federal system Be 
that as it may the questions are raised not because 
there are no elements of federalism in the Nigerian 
Constitution but does the practice of federalism in 
Nigeria conform with the features of federalism In 
this study the regulatory control by state and federal 
governments of oil exploration activities affecting in
land waters is examined against the backdrop of the 
practice of federalism 
Exclusive and Shared Powers
A federal state is usually structured constitutionally 
to reflect and provide for common and exclusive in
terests How the central and state governments cater 
to the interest exclusive to each side is a matter of na
tional pattern of federalism and not according to any 
strict federal system of government definition For 
example Germany‘s allocation of powers to states 
under the federal system being practised in a par
liamentary system is different from how powers are 
shared between the federal government and the states 
in a presidential system The division of powers in 
a federal state is for adequate delineation of politi
cal and statutory authority including responsibilities 
between the federal and states government such that 
matters of national interest should be exclusive to the 
federal government In contrast state governments 
are conferred powers over issues common to states 
and municipalities 26 However where there is a 
convergence of national and subnational interests 
the constitution usually makes provisions for the 
concurrency of federal and subnational powers27 
Usually the federal government‘s exclusive powers 
inter alia include national defence matters foreign af
fairs banking nuclear energy natural resources and 
currency The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Re
public of Nigeria follows the structure where legis
lative powers are classified as exclusive and concur
rent It confers legislative authority on the National 
Assembly over matters on the Exclusive Legislative 
list Constitutional provisions vest executive powers 
in the federal government in implementing the laws 
overseeing such issues28 The states and the federal 
government both have powers to legislate on matters 
specified in the concurrent list to the extent of the 
jurisdictional ambits allowed by the constitutions 
The Exclusive Legislative list has 68 items while 
the concurrent Legislative list has 12 items Besides 
the matters listed in the exclusive and concurrent list 
there are others that form the residual list but are not 
expressly mentioned in the constitution The states 
can legislate over such matters
Separation of Powers
As conceptualised by John Locke and accentuated 
by Montesquieu the doctrine institutionalised a go

verning system divided into three arms of govern
ment executive legislature and judiciary with dis
tinct responsibilities and powers The sanctity of the 
principle is seen in neither of the arms outstepping its 
boundary outside its constitutional roles The doctri
ne is supposed to entrench efficiency through checks 
and balances within the statutory functions with 
each arm performing its role for the smooth and pro
per running of government affairs In keeping with 
this doctrine Part II of the 1999 Constitution provi
des for the powers and functions of the legislature 
executive and judiciary29 The legislature enacts 
the laws the executive implements the laws made by 
the parliament and the judiciary interprets the laws
It is however not a hardclasped doctrine as the Su
preme Court of Nigeria has held that the constitution 
being the foundational norm of a State has a flexib
le disposition to the application of the doctrine To 
this effect through a provision that expressly creates 
an exception the constitution restricts or ignores the 
application of the doctrine of separation of powers 
The Supreme Court of Nigeria in AG Abia v AG 
Federation30 expounded on this legal position 
when it upheld the provision of section 3152 of the 
1999 Constitution which empowers the President as 
the chief executive of the Federation to modify an 
existing law either by way of alteration omission or 
repeal if the President considers it necessary to bring 
such law into conformity with the constitution Furt
hermore the Supreme Court in the aforementioned 
case thereby validated the legislative action of the 
President when he without any recourse to the Na
tional Assembly modified the Allocation of Revenue 
Federation Account etc AmendmentAct 31
Water Resources Administration under the Cons
titution
The federal republic of Nigeria consisting of 36 
states and the federal capital territory of Abuja has a 
land area of about 924000 sq km with surface water 
resources estimated at 2673 billion cubic meters In 
contrast groundwater is estimated to hold a poten
tial volume of 519 billion meters Eight hydrological 
areas were created for administrative purposes while 
River Basin Authorities were established to manage 
them32
Water resource being on the exclusive and concur
rent legislative list in the 1999 Constitution means 
the federal and state governments share responsibi
lity for regulating the use and protection of water re
sources that flow from sources and connect beyond 
one State 33 It means only the federal government 
controls rivers lakes andor channels that flow from 
a source that affects more than one State State go
vernments can only regulate water resources origina
ting and flowing within the State exclusively There 
are presently the following laws at the federal level 
Water Resources Act 1993 Minerals Act1990 Na
tional Inland Waterways Authority Act NIWA Act 
1997 and River Basins Development Authority Act 
RBDA Act 1990 These laws are under the adminis
tration of the Federal Ministry of Water Resources 
The Ministry is responsible for formulating and im
plementing national water policies and developing 
and overseeing water resources infrastructures such 
as dams irrigations and water supply projects
Through their ministries and agencies for water re
sources State governments exercise administrative 
control over water supply irrigation and care for 
river channels within their states provided the river 
channels don‘t flow beyond their State to another 
state But the Federal government has exclusive re
sponsibility for protecting the environment inclu
ding water sources channels underground water 
and every area that constitutes the environment 34 
Given the very limited powers of the state govern
ments over the waters that flow within the boundaries 
of their states the constitution has confined them to 
the role of notifying the federal government in the 
event of oil spillage In most cases the states mediate 
between the MOCs and the affected communities du
ring disputes arising from demands for compensation 
or remedial service for the occurrence of oil spillage 
The National Water Policy published after the Na
tional Council on Water meeting of 2002 sounded 
a strong warning that the nations‘ water sources are 
under serious threat from inadequate management 
and widespread pollution including the indiscrimi
nate disposal of hazardous substances The National 
Council of Water mentioned the uncoordinated ma
nagement of the nation‘s water resources as one of 
the major factors responsible for the legal and insti
tutional structures‘ poor effectiveness in preventing 
pollution and beginning timely remedial actions in 
an oil spill
Legal and Institutional Framework on the Regu
lation of Oil Pollution in Nigeria
Under this subtheme we shall review select legis
lation and institutions that regulate Nigeria‘s oil and 
gas sector The emphasis here is mainly on relevant 
stipulations of the statutes related to the regulation of 
oil pollution in Nigeria and the corresponding agen
cies seeking to ensure compliance with the relevant 
environmental enactments
Legal Framework
The Constitution of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria of 1999
The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
1999 hereafter called CFRN 1999 is the supreme 
law of Nigeria The CFRN 1999 does not make ex
plicit provisions that vest legislative powers in the 
legislature to regulate environmental pollution in Ni
geria 35
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123
httpheejournalunikoelnde
Page 17
However the need to ensure a safe and improved 
environment in Nigeria finds constitutional expres
sion in section 20 under the Fundamental Objectives 
and Directive Principles of State Policy of the CFRN 
1999 It explicitly obligates the State to ‚protect and 
improve the environment and safeguard the water 
air and land forest and wildfire in Nigeria‘ By the 
tenor of this constitutional provision the activities 
relating to the exploration and exploitation of mineral 
oil are expected to be conducted in conformity with 
the objective encapsulated in Section 20 36
Furthermore the constitution prohibits the exploi
tation of human or natural resources in any form 
whatsoever for reasons other than the good of the 
community37 However the enforceability of the 
constitutional provisions in chapter two concerning 
the duty of the government for adequate protection 
and management of the environment is doubtful be
cause they are not justiciable Consequently victims 
of oil pollution of the environment may not find sola
ce in the current regulatory regime
It is instructive to note that notwithstanding the ab
sence of specific constitutional provisions to regulate 
environmental pollution the National Assembly is 
vested with the requisite powers to enact a law that 
governs mines minerals and natural gas38 This 
position finds statutory expression and attestation in 
section 42 CFRN 1999 which provides thus ‚The 
National Assembly shall have the power to make 
laws for the peace order and good government of the 
Federation or any part thereof concerning any matter 
included in the Exclusive Legislative List set out in 
Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Constitution By 
necessary implication the National Assembly is con
ferred with the legislative powers to enact laws rela
ting to mines and minerals including oil and gas and 
other natural resources being the subject of interstate 
commerce Similarly any international agreements 
treaties and conventions relating to environmental 
protection to which Nigeria is a signatory can only 
become enforceable where the National Assembly 
pursuant to Section 12 CFRN 1999 enacts them into 
law Therefore by the provisions of Sections 4 and 12 
CFRN 1999 the power to enter into and implement 
the stipulations of any international environmental 
agreements is clearly within the exclusive competen
ce of the Federal Government Against the backdrop 
of this legislative competence the Federal Govern
ment has since enacted various legislations and the 
attendant regulations that seek to safeguard and pro
tect the environment against oil pollution However 
nothing inhibits the Federation‘s component states 
from making environmental laws provided they do 
not conflict with federal legislation 
To these critical enactments we now turn
National Environmental Standards Regulation 
Establishment Agency Act 2007
The National Environmental Standards Regulation 
Establishment Agency Act 2007 NESREA was 
enacted to replace the Federal Environmental Protec
tion Agency Act 39 Essentially the NESREA Act 
aims at centralising environmental protection and 
management Although the NESREA Act‘s stipulati
ons generally seek to enforce environmental regulati
ons they have severe limitations in that the NESREA 
is not applicable regarding the regulation of the oil 
and gas subsector in Nigeria 40
By the stipulations of Section 7 of the NESREA Act 
the enforcement of environmental regulations rela
ting to oil pollution is explicitly excluded Thus the 
NESREA Act does not apply to Nigeria‘s oil and gas 
industry Interestingly the NESREA Act is supposed 
to be a comprehensive resourceoriented enactment 
seeking sustainable utilisation and conservation of 
natural resources visàvis environmental protection 
It is against this background that one cannot fathom 
the rationale behind the exclusion of oil pollution 
from the provisions of the NESREA Act However 
one can reasonably posit that lack of the needed po
litical will and enlightened selfinterest may have ac
counted for such damaging exclusion   The reason 
is that from the year of the Koko toxic waste dump 
incident in 1988 it was expected that the government 
would have envisaged the vulnerability of the Niger

The National Oil Spill Detection Response Agen
cy Establishment Act 2006
The National Oil Spill Detection Response Agency 
Establishment Act 2006 otherwise termed NOS
DRA Act 2006 was enacted in response to the ag
gravated environmental degradation resulting from 
oil pollution particularly in the oilproducing states 
in Nigeria 41 The NOSDRA Act was enacted to 
implement and coordinate Nigeria‘s National Oil 
Spill Contingency Plan NOSCP
The NOSDRA Act is principally concerned with 
the enforcement against violations resulting from oil 
pollution of the environment In furtherance of this 
the NOSDRA Act established NOSDRA as the co
ordinating and monitoring agency for implementing 
the Federal Government of Nigeria‘s policies on the 
National Oil Spill Contingency Plan By the provisi
ons of the NOSDRA Act an oil spiller by whose ope
rations environmental pollution is occasioned shall 
be liable to the imposition of penalties for failure to 
report an oil spill incident and clean up the resultant 
environmental degradation 42
The Environmental Impact Assessment Act
The Environmental Impact Assessment Act 43 
EIA Act is principally concerned with considerati
ons of the environmental impact resulting from signi
ficant public and private projects The EIA provides 
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123

Page 18
for the operation and maintenance of a public regis
ter giving the public access to information on poten
tial hazards likely to impact environmental health 
and safety negatively This EIA Act stipulates an as
sessment of the possible environmental consequen
ces of any proposed project Accordingly an assess
ment of the likely impact of public or private projects 
on the natural environment is required 44 Further 
by the provisions of the EIA a written application 
to the agency before embarking on projects for their 
environmental assessment to ascertain approval is re
quired The EIA Act sets out the situations that requi
re environmental impact assessment and establishes 
legal liability for the infringement of any stipulation 
under the EIA Act 45
It is to be noted that any person who fails to comply 
with the provisions of this Act shall be guilty of an 
offence under the same and liable upon conviction 
In the case of an individual liability can mean a fine 
of up to N10000000 or five years imprisonment 
In the case of a firm or corporation the liability is a 
fine of not less than N5000000 and not more than 
N10000000 Again the existence of such dispro
portionality relative to penalty for noncompliance 
further highlights the inadequacies and weaknesses 
inherent in Nigeria‘s environmental law enforcement 
mechanism
Although the EIA is a critical piece of environmen
tal legislation the effective execution of its provisi
ons is primarily hampered by the inadequacies and 
misrepresentations of several environmental regula
tory enactments hence the overlapping of functions 
and responsibilities in processes and procedures by 
the various regulatory agencies
Notwithstanding these constraints this Act crea
tes the general principles procedures and methods 
to enable the prior consideration of environmental 
impact assessment of planned public or private pro
jects46 It must be emphasised here that the EIA 
applies to other sectors‘ environmental activities 
Still the focus here is on its application related to 
mitigating oil pollution of the environment
The Petroleum Industry Act
The Petroleum industry Act 202147 repealed the 
Petroleum Act 2004 It has created a wide range of 
provisions and innovations that will affect the stake
holders of the private sector public sector and oil 
and gas industry Its objectives are to provide a legal 
governance regulatory and fiscal framework for the 
Nigerian Petroleum Industry set up and develop host 
communities in the oil sector and deal with related 
matters in the upstream midstream and downstream 
sectors
Being the foundational enactment concerning oil 
acquisition rights in Nigeria the Act in this regard 
makes elaborate provisions for the exploration and 
exploitation of mineral oil in Nigeria Accordingly 
Section 1 vests the entire ownership and control of all 
petroleum in under or upon any lands to which this 
section applies in the State
Pursuant to the provisions of the Act the Minister 
of Petroleum Resources is vested with the power to 
conduct general supervision over the operations un
dertaken based on licenses and leases granted under 
the Act 48 In replacement of the Department of 
Petroleum Resources the Act created regulators for 
the petroleum industry the Nigerian Upstream Pet
roleum Regulatory Commission the „Commission“
49 and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream 
Petroleum Authority the „Authority“50
Institutional Framework
Although several institutions in Nigeria regulate 
monitor and enforce compliance with environmental 
enactments and regulations only a selected number 
of these governmental institutions shall be conside
red here
The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory 
Commission the „Commission“
The Commission is a corporate body with perpetual 
successions whose regulatory functions are limited to 
the upstream petroleum activities as provided for in 
Section 4 of the Act which stipulates  that „the Com
mission is responsible for the technical and com
mercial regulation of the upstream petroleum opera
tions“ Amongst other functions of the Commission 
is establishing compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations governing upstream petroleum ope
rations It is also the lead agency ensuring industry 
compliance with safety and environmental regulati
ons 51
Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum 
Authority the „Authority“
As provided under Section 293 of the Petroleum 
Industry Act the petroleum industry‘s midstream 
and downstream petroleum operations are regulated 
by this regulatory authority on a technical and com
mercial basis Section 111 of the Act provides that 
the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum 
Authority may grant renew modify or extend in
dividual licenses or permits provided that where it 
relates to the establishment of refineries such licen
ces or permits shall be issued by the Minister on the 
recommendation of the Authority According to Sec
tion 125 of the Act midstream and downstream gas 
operations require a license to perform activities such 
as establishing building or operating gas processing 
facilities engaging in bulk transportation of natural 
gas by rail barge or other means of transportation 
operating gas transportation networks engaging in 
wholesale gas supply or constructing or operating 
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123

Page 19
chemical and fertiliser plants Under the Act the Au
thority must also develop midstream and downstream 
gas operations regulations Such regulations should 
include the establishment of a wholesale natural gas 
market to guarantee the availability of natural gas to 
customers including pipeline owners and operators 
shippers of natural gas holders of natural gas storage 
and distribution licenses and gas retailers as well as 
any other activities related to the above
The National Oil Spill Detection and Response 
Agency NOSDRA
NOSDRA is an agency in the Federal Ministry of 
Environment FME in Nigeria established in 2006 
pursuant to the NOSDRA Act specifically to deal 
with oil spills and ensure compliance by the oil in
dustries to best practices in their operations52 
The primary responsibility of NOSDRA is oil spill 
detection response and management53 Therefo
re the NOSDRA coordinates the implementation of 
the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan NOSCP 
in Nigeria in conformity with the International Con
vention on Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and 
Cooperation to which Nigeria is a signatory54 It 
is gratifying to note that NOSDRA has continued to 
ensure compliance with environmental enactments 
and regulations that seek to protect and manage the 
environment against oil pollution by the petroleum 
industry
Consequently the NOSDRA Establishment Act 
vests the NOSDRA with the power to be responsible 
for surveillance and ensure compliance with all exis
ting environmental legislation and the detection of oil 
spills in the petroleum sector55 In carrying out its 
statutory mandate the NOSDRA receives oil spill re
ports and coordinates oil spill response operations in  
Nigeria It ensures timely effective and appropriate 
response to oil spills that endangers the environment 
and cleanup activities of oil pollution that ultima
tely lead to environmental degradation particularly 
in the oilproducing states of the NigerDelta area of 
Nigeria
National Environmental Standards and Regulati
ons Enforcement Agency NESREA 
The NESREA is an environmental agency of the 
Federal Government of Nigeria established pursu
ant to the provisions of the NESREA Act56 The 
NESREA is statutorily empowered to enforce all en
vironmental legislation in Nigeria and international 
conventions or treaties to which Nigeria is a party for 
protecting the environment This mandate of NES
REA further complies with the articulated strategy of 
the National Policy on Environment that obligated 
the government to establish legal institutions for pro
tecting and managing the environment57
Although the NESREA has recorded enormous 
achievements relative to environmental compliance 
monitoring and enforcement since its creation inclu
ding making various regulations concerning environ
mental protection monitoring environmental com
pliance and enforcement activities its powers do not 
cover environmental pollution relating to oil and gas 
matters It must be emphasised that NESREA‘s bro
ad powers to enforce international conventions and 
treaties are subject to ratification and domestication 
by the Nigerian legislature58 
Factors Responsible for Uncoordinated Manage
ment of Water Resources
Nigeria‘s water sources and resources are spread 
across the six geopolitical areas and the majority of 
the states of the Federation Factors clogging effec
tive management of the water resources can be de
scribed thus
Centralised Regulatory System Given the expan
sive network of rivers and tributaries it is extremely 
burdensome and almost impossible to have an effec
tive regulatory mechanism concentrated at the centre 
as is presently the case with the Federal Ministry of 
Water Resources and other relevant federal agencies 
The constitution provides for the regulation of acti
vities relating to the waterways in the exclusive list 
The Water Resources Act 1991 grants the Minister 
for Water Resources enormous powers Section 8d 
says the powers of the Minister include to „prohibit 
or regulate the carrying out of any activities on land 
or water which are likely to interfere with the quan
tity or quality of any water in any watercourse or 
groundwater“ On account of the combined effect of 
the provisions of the Act and the 1999 Constitution 
the state governments through their environment mi
nistries can only conduct or control activities related 
to intrastate water resources The consequence is 
seen in the slow or nonresponse to water pollution 
incidents caused by oil spillage or dumping of hazar
dous waste by MOCs 
Lack of Judicial Interpretation of Statutory 
Control Even though the federal system being prac
tised in Nigeria has been described and criticised as 
semiunitary and vests too many statutory powers 
and responsibilities in the federal government there 
are aspects of the constitution that allows room for 
judicial interpretation in the light of true federalism 
and the theoretical concept upon which it is foun
ded Though this paper explains the provision of the 
1999 Constitution based on its incorporation of the 
management of water sources and resources in the 
exclusive list some scholars still consider the water 
resources as being on the concurrent list The specific 
powers and roles of the state governments need to 
be expressly determined by the court for states and 
federal governments to understand their respective 
judicial power to allow for adequate coordination of 
the management and control of the water resources
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123
httpheejournalunikoelnde

Limitations of the National Water Resources Bill 
2020
Section 21 of the Bill provides that „All surface 
water and groundwater wherever it occurs is a re
source common to all people the use of which is 
subject to statutory control There shall be no private 
ownership of water but the right to use water in ac
cordance with the provisions of this Act“ Similarly 
section 75 of the Bill also provides that „no corporate 
organisation or individual shall commence boreho
le drilling business in Nigeria unless such driller has 
been issued Water Driller‘s license“
Therefore the wording of this provision is in breach 
of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nige
ria 1999 and established judicial authorities on the 
subject Thus in Attorney General Lagos State v 
AttorneyGeneral Federation 59 The Supreme 
Court held that „In the circumstance I have to say 
that Professor Osinbajo is right in my view in his 
submission that urban and regional planning for the 
Federal Capital Territory Abuja is within the exclusi
ve legislative function of the National Assembly but 
only by virtue of Section 299a conferring residual 
power on it and not controversial section 20 of the 
constitution Similarly each state House of Assembly 
has the exclusive function of making planning laws 
and regulations for the state under its residual power 
It follows that the National Assembly cannot make a 
law in the form and detail of the Nigerian Urban and 
Regional Planning Decree 88 of 1992 That will be 
in clear breach of the principles of federalism and an 
incursion into the legislative jurisdiction of the states 
But the National Assembly can make planning laws 
for the Federal Capital Territory Again the Natio
nal Assembly cannot enact any law in contravention 
of the constitution imposing any responsibility on a 
state and expecting obedience to such a law It is a 
noncontroversial philosophy of federalism that the 
Federal Government does not exercise supervisory 
authority over the State Government“
Consequently the state government not the Federal 
Government is exclusively vested with the powers 
over physical planning matters In essence it is not 
within the legislative competence stipulated in the 
Bill federal government to grant approval or licen
ses to individuals or corporate bodies who desire to 
sink boreholes outside the Federal Capital Territory 
60 The Bill further stated that „in implementing 
the principles under subsection 2 of this section the 
institutions established under this Act shall promote 
integrated water resources management and the co
ordinated management of land and water resources 
surface water and groundwater resources river ba
sins and adjacent marines and coastal environment 
and upstream and downstream 61 
It follows from the tenor of this provision that 
the Ministry of Water Resources is vested with the 
powers to formulate national policy and water re
sources management strategy to guide the integrated 
planning management development use and con
servation of the nation‘s water resources and provide 
guidance for the formulation of hydrological area re
sources strategies 62
Conclusion
The Niger Delta area is the oilproducing area in 
Nigeria where oil exploration and exploitation opera
tions are sustained Consequently the region suffers 
from tremendous environmental degradation inclu
ding damage to aquatic life inhabitants and the ent
ire ecosystem The impact of oil pollution is further 
aggravated by the inequitable allocation of revenue 
to mitigate the harsh consequences of environmen
tal degradation connected with oil exploration acti
vities The challenges of lack of equitable funding 
and lack of efficacious statutory control of the water 
resources by the state governments are offshoots of 
the structure and contents of the federal constitution 
the fundamental law of the Federation Water pollu
tion caused by oil spills causes monumental environ
mental disasters that usually demand a prompt and 
comprehensive response from the time of detection 
to the completion of environmental restoration The 
statutory responsibility for detection and response 
should be that of the state governments because they 
are closer to the spill site and are directly responsible 
for providing clean water to the population Based on 
the constitution‘s provisions the federal government 
has exercised its powers by establishing the National 
Oil Detection and Response Agency in 2006 to co
ordinate the implementation of the National Oil Spill 
Contingency Plan But there is a lack of synergy in 
executing the operational mandates of the agency 
and the state ministries of the environment By the 
provision of the Act establishing it and the federal 
government‘s constitutional powers the agency can 
rightly access any water resource site and carry out 
detection or remedial activities without the consent 
or coordination of the state government This can be 
problematic and can slow the pace of detection and 
response if the affected communities are uncoopera
tive and the state government is not receptive
Furthermore the proposed National Water Bill will 
deepen the already overcentralised administration 
of environmental matters in the executive arm of the 
federal government The intended legislation by its 
provisions negates the objectives of the Land Use 
Act was promulgated and subsequently preserved by 
the 1999 Constitution By the tenor of the Land Use 
Act the governors of the states are vested with ab
solute powers over land in their states Consequently 
the provision of the Land Use Act vesting absolute 
powers on the governors of states relative to land in 
their domain cannot be derogated from by the provi
sions of the National Water Resources Bill This is 
against the background that the Land Use Act enjoys 
constitutional protection under the 1999 Constriction 
The Journal of Health Environment  Education 14 1123
httpheejournalunikoelnde
Page 21
64 This position finds judicial approval in Nkwo
cha v Governor of Anambra State 63 wherein 
the Supreme Court held that the Land Use Act is not 
an integral part of the constitution but claims the spe
cial protection of section 92 of the constitution in 
terms of its amendment It is in the light of this that 
the Bill suffers a fatal blow and is thus rendered un
constitutional to the extent that it seeks to vest the 
control over water resources on land within states on 
the Federal Government
A constitutional amendment stipulating that the fe
deral and state governments are to have shared re
sponsibility for maintaining and controlling water 
resources is highly desirable It will enhance the effi
cacy of already established supervisory and regulato
ry institutions and allow some of the responsibilities 
of the MOCs to the environment where they operate 
to be regulated by state governments Additional
ly the Petroleum Industry Act should be amended 
to subject the activities of operators in the industry 
regarding environmental management to the regula
tory oversight of the NESREA and not the Nigerian 
Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission as is 
currently the case
In the end it should be the subnationals who con
trol the water resources in their respective spheres 
without interference from any federal agency  It is 
unlikely that the provisions in the proposed law will 
be able to resolve the confusion and contradictions 
inherent in the CRFN It will instead result in a grea
ter centralization of administrative control over re
sources and undermine the effectiveness of agencies 
that must deal with the entire country in its vastness 
A federal system of governance in Nigeria is being 
debated and agitated for where subnationals are 
more in control of natural resources in their states 
Therefore more research will be necessary in order 
to ensure that a future constitution does not retain the 
present challenges and confusion
