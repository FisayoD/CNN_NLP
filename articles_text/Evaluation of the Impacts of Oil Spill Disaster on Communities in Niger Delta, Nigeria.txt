Abstract 
The discovery of Oil and Gas in Nigeria led to exploration of crude oil for 
revenue basis Oil exploration and exploitation caused environmental prob
lems which resulted into major conflicts in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria 
The article examines the impact of oil exploration and oil and gas conflicts in 
Niger Delta area and it highlights the problems of pipeline vandalism struc
ture of oil and gas and the general obstacles in the industry It discovers that 
pipeline vandalism crude oil theft pollution oil spillage causes serious envi
ronmental degradation which resulted into serious conflicts The article dis
covered that environmental problems in the area dislodged the people of their 
means of livelihood both in the area of fishing and farming It recommends 
that there should be a compelling environmental restoration of natural re
sources by deploying land treatment technologies Government should sanc
tion multinational companies discharging oils or creating environmental pollu
tion through necessary laws and regulations

Nigeria was known for its agricultural products The major products were cocoa 
from the west groundnut and cotton from the North and Palm oil from the east 
with Niger Delta inclusive  
The primary research goal is to compare policy issues affecting the imple

exploration in Nigeria and the impact on achieving the goal of universal envi
ronmental quality Oil exploration by multinational and local companies poses 
social health and economic challenges in the society but the right set of policies 
can equip society to meet these challenges on time 
From the creation of Nigeria in the year 1914 to the end of colonialism agri
culture remained the chief source of the economy During the colonial period 
from 19141959 Nigeria was exploited for its agricultural products The major 
products were cocoa from the west groundnut and cotton from the North and 
Palm oil from the east with Niger Delta inclusive  
Revenue from oil in the early 1960’s accounted for less than 10 of Nigeria’s 
revenue base The Oil and Gas Journal of 2005 estimated Nigeria’s oil reserves 
to be at 352 billion barrels In February 2005 Nigeria announced the award of 5 
oil blocks in the Joint Development Zone shared by the neighboring areas such 
as Sao Tome and Principe The JDZ at the time held reserves of 11 billion bar
rels and could yield up to 3 million barrels a day Nigeria also had an estimation 
of 176 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves where the country would 
have done one of the top ten natural gas endowments in the world and the larg
est endowment in Africa and with over 200 trillo cubic feet TCF of proven gas 
reserves Twumasi and Merem 2006 it holds the biggest gas deposits in Africa 
and is currently the continent’s biggest LNG exporter 
2 Structure of the Oil and Gas Industry 
The oil industry is mainly confined into the offshore and onshore parts of the 
Niger Delta Tyokumber 2014 The industry is usually considered to be divided 
into distinct classes of the upstream and downstream sector 
The upstream sector This is basically exploration services carried out within 
the oil wells They include prospecting production and transportation of oil 
which in simpler terms mean the searching for of oil deposits in commercial 
qualities the actual pumping of the discovered oil out of the ground and the 
movement of the unrefined crude oil to the refineries 
The downstream sector This is the most important stage where the oil is 
now refined into various products like petrol diesel kerosene etc This is the 
most important stage because it is the stage where the crude oil is transformed 
into its most valuable stage The actual stage that makes oil exploration a very 
lucrative business After these stages the refined products are transported to 
customers by pipelines sea road and rail tankers These activities have adverse 
effects on the flora and fauna of these oilrich areas These effects and their re
mediation are the basis of this research 
3 Obstacles Faced in the Oil and Gas Industry of Nigeria 
Although Nigeria is the 10th largest oil producer in the world and the 3rd larg
est in Africa it still has so many obstacles that are preventing it from reaching its 
full potential as an oil producing country Most of the crude oil in Nigeria comes 
from numerous producing fields located in Niger Delta Anambra state Benue

state Chad Basin and Benin Quadri 2018 The products are also exported 
through 7 terminals and a number of floating production vessels However I 
would be discussing the obstacles and challenges faced in this aspect of oil 
exploration in Nigeria with emphasis to the Niger Delta and they are as fol
lows 
31 Pipeline Vandalism 
Oil Pipeline Vandalism is the act of drilling into the pipelines with the intent to 
steal the products deterioration of pipelines used in transportation networks 
makes these pipelines vulnerable to punctures breaks and exposure for vandals 
with the sole purpose of stealing petroleum products 
This is basically an action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to 
petroleum pipelines with the sole aim of stealing crude oil and associated petro
leum products The effects of the above acts are huge economic losses from the 
pipeline and plant shutdown due to the destruction made to get the oil out ille
gally environmental pollution which consists of both Land Water and air de
pending on the location of the pipe busted fire outbreaks by virtue of spillage 
made coming in contact with other flammable substances Ukoli 2001 All 
these in return amount to scarcity and shortage of petroleum products and a re
duction in electric power generation 
32 Crude Oil Theft 
Nigeria has a record of over 1 million barrels lost to corporate oil thieves This is 
because most oil companies base their total production figures on estimated 
volumes using dipsticks to make volume calculations This form of data man
agement and calculation is prone to manipulation especially through the altera
tion of physical properties of the crude at the exportation stage Molecular 
Power System which is a due diligence company was engaged to provide techni
cal data records of crude oil and liquefied natural gas lifting in Nigeria as ob
tained from the NNPC and landing certificates at global destinations to verify 
the possibilities of nondeclaration to the federal government by multinational 
companies In subsequent investigations made it was confirmed that the crude 
oil declared to have been exported from Nigeria between January 2011 and De
cember 2014 was less than what was imported into the United States of America 
from Nigeria 
33 Pollution 
Tolulope 2004 and Ukoli 2001 this is basically introducing contaminating or 
foreign bodies into water land air or even as a form of noise These are the ex
isting forms of pollution that can be derived from oil and gas exploitation and 
exploration in Nigeria and around the globe It is the slow poisoning of the 
abovementioned areas of the environment and destruction of Vegetation and 
agricultural land by oil spills which occur during operations Tolulope 2004 
This is the exact problem and issue in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria The

government have been quite reluctant and uninterested to control these envi
ronmental problems created by the industry though there are a couple of exist
ing laws provided to this effect which are either repugnant or inactive in the 
execution stage The United Nations Development Programme UNDP re
port shows that there has been a total of 6817 oil spills between 1976 and 2001 
which is equal to 3 million barrels of oil of which 70 was never recovered 69 
happened offshore and a quarter which was in swamps and the remaining 6 
was spilled on land 
34 Inadequate Pipeline Infrastructure 
This has been said to be our major challenge in the domestic gas supply and 
market growth In relation to this it is also seen that the available gas infra
structure in the country was largely limited to the Escravos Lagos Pipeline Sys
tem ELPS adding that most of the other gas pipelines were project specific 
pointtopoint and lacks flexibility This is also in conjunction with poor gas 
funding etc 
35 Fire Outbreak 
This is basically caused by mismanagement of petroleum products or raw mate
rials itself Nigerian Oil Production has been said to have killed over 2000 people 
from fire outbreaks In relation to this fact the operation has also led to the 
death of people through diseased water caused by oil spillage This spillage is 
up to 540 million gallons and it may cost a thousand dollars to return it back 
to restitution  
4 Effects of the Poor Management of the Environment  
Caused by Oil Exploration in Nigeria 
41 Transfrontier Pollution 
This is a form of pollution generated in one country and is transferred to an
other country by air or water This form of pollution causes damages and illness 
and generally constitutes nuisance in the affected places it resides The solution 
to this form of pollution in for it to be solved internationally and for awareness 
and deliberate attempts to be made and practiced by the citizens or culprits re
sponsible for such pollution The pollution from the Niger Delta on a scale could 
be regarded as one of the worst among similar delta areas in the world The Ni
ger Delta has a humid semihot equatorial climate Ana 2011 The tempera
ture ranges are small and constant through the year The hottest month in the 
Niger Delta 28 degree Celsius which is also approximated to 824 Faren
height and its coolest month is at 26 degrees Celsius which can also be equated 
to 78degree Farenheight with the temperature range of not more than 
2degree Celsius 5 Farenheight Precipitation The nature of this environment 
is such that it rains almost all year round with short breaks in August and longer 
breaks from December to January As a result of this the area is usually flooded 
A T Bello T Nwaeke

and this flooding also extends to urban areas Another disadvantage of this is 
that the soil consists of mainly Silt and clay and as such becomes saturated when 
this happens the soil quality is thereby reduced to its barest minimum and leads 
to runoffs These transfrontier pollutions in the Niger Delta have now en
camped around Rivers state as its effects or residue which is the black sooth is 
now all over areas in Rivers State and majorly in PortHarcourt This form of 
pollution makes the atmosphere unconducive for people because it affects the 
breathing or inhalation causes other forms of challenges to the respiratory sys
tem It also settles in the water on surfaces and the clothing of residents making 
the environment highly uncomfortable for people to stay in Similar cases like 
this can be seen in the 1988 KOKO INCIDENT case where toxic and harmful 
waste was dumped and the effects were similar to that of this black soot caused 
by gas flaring and illegal oil bunker in the Niger Delta and some areas of Rivers 
state too  
42 Corrosion Effects on Materials and Other Artefacts 
The acid rainfall in the Niger Delta increases the corrosion rate of metal oil pipe 
casings used to transport oil to various areas When such metals are corrosed it 
emits pollutants into the atmosphere and it thereby pollutes the environment for 
people to breathe in good air and live healthy A similar situation was seen in 
the MINAMATA Case of 1956 Where citizens in Japan died as a result of 
methyl mercury in the water When the metal pipes or their casings get cor
rosed in the water the disadvantage involved is that it endangers the health of 
the residents and other living organisms that exist thereby reducing biodiver
sity of animal migration in the environment When these organisms are re
duced or gotten rid of completely it renders the men in the community jobless 
as their major occupation there is fishing and hunting games Again when the 
environment gets too unfriendly for the residents’ health wise they have to 
leave the area to save themselves and at the same time this people may not af
ford the means or resources to leave the environment leading to a life and death 
situation 
5 Oil Spillage in Nigeria Data Analysis from 19902021 
In recent times 881 cases of oil spills have been recorded between January 2019 
and April 2021 This spillage happened in 12 states within the country The in
formation stated above is obtained from a governmentrun satellite tracker 
known as the NOSDRA It was also recorded that 77 percent of the spills majorly 
occurred in only 3 oilproducing states in Nigeria The total oil spillage within 
this period has been equated to about 43000 barrels of oil of which the monetary 
value is worth 3 million at the international market and 123 billion naira in the 
national markets It is proper to understand that these figures are not static be
cause more spills are still recorded on daily bases Akinpelu 2021 States with 
the highest spills includes Rivers Delta and Bayelsa States respectively With 
Rivers State leading by 352 spills Delta State by 233 spills and Bayelsa State by 89

spills which is equal to 674 spills in total Table 1 
In terms of quantifying the total oil spills made about 26268 barrels have 
been recorded to be lost in Rivers state 1219 barrels lost in Bayelsa State and 
9134 barrels lost on Delta State respectively such data is captured in Figure 1 
Oil spills lead to health and environmental and socioeconomic problems All 
the effects of oil spillage are a threat to the ecosystem and peoples means of live
lihood It has already been mentioned in this research work that oil spillage 
usually occurs when infrastructures are poorly built or maintained It also oc
curs when there is theft or vandalism by criminals and when accidents due to 
negligence or other vices happen When incidents like this occur there is sup
posed to be a cleanup exercise by the culprits involved but research has shown 
that there are very low records of successful cleanups by some defaulting 
companies The oil spillage data also reveals spillage records from the 1970’s 
and the average number of spills were 79 annually but by 2010 it decreased to 
50 ITOPF Wed Design Agency 2022 This is better explained in Figure 2 
below  
Most of these spills identified by the NOSDRA in the past years were as a re
sult of oil theft and exploration sabotage also known as oil bunkering Another 
effect of this oil theft has led to a major issue in areas like Rivers State where 
airborne transfrontier pollution known as soot has invaded the city and neigh
boring villages as well Oil theft affects the nation’s pipeline facilities and creates 
massive drain on the economy and environment of the country A total of 3342 
pipeline points were vandalized across Nigeria from October 2018September 
2020 Reports of pipeline repair summed up to 15 billion naira from January

2019January 2022 It is lawful for oil companies or multinationals to close off 
oil spill sites within at least 24 hours of being notified of a spill After which a 
survey should be carried out to note the extent of the spill This is to be done in 
the presence of the community representatives the company’s representatives 
and relevant government agencies or officials Kareem 2022 When clean ups 
are carried out the evidence of successful clean ups will be presented to the re
levant authorities In a case where there is a breech in facility the oil company 
who was at work at the time will take responsibilities for it whether the spill was 
due to their operational negligence or not or by fraudulent members of the host 
communities This may raise an argument on whether or not the company is still 
supposed to pay compensation to the host community if they were the ones re
sponsible for the oil spill The answer to this is that companies should only be 
asked to pay compensation of oil spillage to host communities if the spill is the 
Company’s doing Akinpelu 2021 If it’s not the company’s fault then the local 
government in charge and within the host company will take liability for the ef
fects of the spill caused by its community 
6 What Triggers Oil Spills 
Oil bunkering has become one of the most lucrative jobs in this part of the 
world This is as a result of so many reasons Such reasons include Poverty Lack 
of Jobs opportunities and the get rich quick syndrome These reasons are basi
cally from the aspect of host communities that are also guilty of causing oil spil
lage The major factors of oil spill triggers include operational negligence from 
companies and theft It is unlawful for identified oil spills not to be reported 
within reasonable time of occurrence The policy of the polluter pays principle 
has not been effectively upheld because the already informed parties involved 
will not want to report to ensure that the cleanup is done properly Instead it 
has been observed that they would rather conceal the occurrence from the 
knowledge of the officials in other to embezzle funds allocated for such clean ups 
to be done The result of this corrupt practice breeds nothing but a very unheal
thy and degraded environment within the host communities and the state at 
large On the flip side host communities have been reported for preventing en
vironmental repairs and maintenance from these oilspillage cleanup teams 
from doing their job which primarily is to return their affected environments to 
their near prepolluted state to make it more safe and habitable for them The 
acts and attitudes of these host communities have planted a form off distrust and 
discouragement in the minds of the few oil companies who want to do right by 
them host communities in the aspect of being responsible for spills caused by 
their exploration events and implementing the cleanups as they should be 
7 Management of Oil Spills 
Oil spill incidents in the Niger Delta have been regarded as normal and regular 
happenings In the previous part of this work the ides or measure such as oil

Journal of Geoscience and Environment Protection 
 
cleanup has been mentioned a number of times This cleanup can come in 
several ways if the right equipment and technologies are used Other approaches 
to manage oil spills in the Niger Delta include the Bioremediation Approach 
Ukdiss 2021 This is used in the evacuation of oil spilled under certain geo
graphic and climate conditions This approach comes after a routine mechanical 
cleanup has been carried out on the affected land It promotes the total eradica
tion of hazardous waste to a different area of the environment Another form is 
that if the Mechanical Containment which has to do with other forms of oil spill 
Control mechanisms The instruments used in this category are booms skim
mers and natural synthetic sorbent materials Booms are cleanup materials used 
mostly to correct oil spillage in the marine bodies They are built for quick re
sponse in the area where a spill occurred while skimmers are used in conjunc
tion with booms as they aid in the extraction of crude oil spills from the surface 
of the water bodies There are also physical methods of cleanup that could be 
adopted by defaulting companies It consists of the use of natural methods like 
evaporation oxidation and biodegradation This is the method that Nigeria has 
adopted and it has been in use since the rise of pollution incidents in the country 
because it requires little or no technology and it does not require a lot of finan
cial commitment This method tends to be slow for the amount and depth of 
pollution done in the Niger Delta As a result of this environmental degradation 
becomes so intense before the effect of the adopted cleanup method can take 
effect There is a longer version of naturally method which is called Remedia
tion Remediation is an act of reversing environmental damage Research shows 
that it seeks to return an already polluted site into its prepolluted state The 
procedure to Remediation includes removing the affected soil and taking it 
elsewhere to clean out the hazardous waste in which the affected land now car
ries and returning it back to the area it was extracted from After these steps are 
carried out the land will be inspected by the relevant authorities and certified by 
the government agencies that such land or areas have been properly cleaned up 
8 Summary 
The research covers the structure of oil and gas industry upstream and down
stream sector obstacles in the oil and gas industry pipeline vandalism crude oil 
theft pollution inadequate pipeline infrastructure effects of poor management 
among others stating the negative effects of excessive degradation due to oil ex
ploration and conflicts in Niger Delta area 
9 Conclusion 
Based on the result on the research work conducted  
1 It was deduced that oil exploration and exploitation services have caused 
alterations in the environment These alterations have been examined and have 
been recorded to be Negative ones 
2 This research work has given a rise of hope that the terrible and devastating 
state of the Niger Delta can be salvaged and restored to normality if multina

tional are properly monitored within their period of operations  
3 Proper monitoring is lacking in the Niger Delta region to a great extent  
4 It is also advised that companies should follow the proper protocols before 
starting up their exploration services in various areas of the country and not just 
the Niger Delta alone The Federal Government has already put in place laws 
rules and policies to be adopted by these multinational companies to curb these 
excesses of oil services from further destroying the environment but corruption 
is ruining everything gradually 
5 The government should not give up on the current state of the Niger Delta 
because if funds are continually put into the restorative cleanup project the af
fected areas would become good and habitable once again with no side effects 
attached to it 
6 Finally Mediation has been said to be a crucial aspect of this conflicts that 
have arisen in the past this is because it seeks to reduce tension and also man
ages public and social progress well so it is also advised to be adopted in this 
case 
10 Recommendations 
The Niger Delta and other oil affected areas within Nigeria deserves to be res
tored This will go a long way in terminating the devastating legacy of oil pro
duction in Nigeria When looking into the restoration of the land to a better 
state the rights of the people host communities should be put into considera
tion first 
1 The issue of conflict and violence should be eradicated This can be achieved 
by improving the security policies within the affected regions There should also 
be a public protest against ant form of human right violation by the multina
tional companies 
2 Public condemnation of acts of repression against environmental activities 
should be encouraged 
3 Mediation with host communities should also be supported This includes 
working with communities to end unhealthy competition amongst ethnic groups 
for resources Equitable units for distributing resources should also be deter
mined 
4 A Judicial reform should be sought after by the government to curb corrup
tion and disobedience to existing laws Multinationals should ensure that indi
genes and habitants find justice to protest any form of marginalization Multina
tionals should also cease from influencing judicial officials into protecting their 
selfish interests to curb corruption and enable the goal of judicial reformation to 
be met 
5 Environmental Restoration can be achieved when we stop the practice of 
illegal dumping of oil and other hazardous wastes within our environment This 
also includes prosecuting employees and officials responsible for authorizing il
legal dumping Adherence to DPR regulations for cleanups should also be en

couraged 
6 Another way to curb the issue in the Niger Delta is to conserve Natural Re
sources Multinationals should see the need to commit to pursuing research on 
technologies for natural resource recovery and should also develop and deploy 
land treatment technologies 
7 Multinationals should help improve the standard of living in the host 
communities by still paying the required compensations to the benefactors when 
and where necessary 
8 In all these suggestions it would only come in highly recommended that 
Nigerian Government redirects its investment to renewable energy sources to 
reduce environmental pollution generally and the over use of our natural re
sources This is where the application of the resource curse theory comes in 
It is important to understand that most of these recommendations have al
ready been provided for in relevant environmental laws but the enforceability is 
lacking This research work also suggests that new legislations that effectively 
tackle the problems faced by the multinationals and their conducts within their 
host communities should be duly implemented and enforced by the Federal 
government
